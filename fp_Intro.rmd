# Introduction

The infant sex ratio (SR1) is an important population-level dimension of maternal and infant health (physical and mental), and sex ratios among infants and children in a population have great potential as indicators of well-being of mothers and children (two groups for whom other measures of health and welfare are often lacking).^[As discussed below, high values of child sex ratios are familiar from social science research on "missing girls". Our attention to *low* sex ratios among infant and children is an extension of recent research on the sex ratio at birth (SRB) as a population-level health indicator: e.g. James and Grech (2018), Grech and Masukume (2016). Earlier work identified reductions in the SBR as a result of stressful events (floods, earthquakes, severe family health events, and the 9-11 attacks: see Lyster (1965); Fukuda et al. (1998); Hansen, Møller, and Olsen (1999); Catalano et al. (2005)). ] The sex ratio at birth (SRB) in a healthy population tends towards 106 males per 100 females, but decreases with maternal stress.^[For a healthy SRB of 106 see e.g. Maconochie and Roman (1997), who report a SRB of 1.058 in over 1/2 million births in Scotland for the period 1975-1988. For the SRB decreasing with maternal stress, see e.g. West and Grech (2020). See also James and Grech (2017), on the considerable debate over precise mechanisms and evolutionary implications, because of which the SRB "remains one of the most longstanding unresolved problems in the biological sciences" (2017:50).] And on biological grounds, child sex ratios fall as mortality rises, because among infants and children, mortality tends to be relatively greater among males than females.^[See e.g. Waldron (1983:324-25). See also Hammoud (1965). An early and convenient statement of male-biased infant and child mortality is offered in the 1861 Census of Scotland: "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females".] Absent sex-based differences in nutrition and care, deleterious living conditions for pregnant women, infants, and nursing mothers in a population will be reflected in low ratios of boys to girls -- at birth, in infancy, and among children.^[Although female-biased mortality is a possibility for a few diseases (Garenne and Lafon 1986:176), on the whole it seems clear that it requires sex-based discrimination against girls in nutrition and care to generate a rising sex ratio in a population (where the population is large enough that random fluctuations in the sex ratio cancel out).] Elevated child sex ratios have been a focus of attention in social science research pursuing Sen's (1990, 1992) insights on the problem of "missing women" in the context of mortal misogny, but depressed child sex ratios are simpler indicators of deleterious conditions of life for pregnant women and nursing children. Of particular importance for research on historical populations, evidence on infant and child sex ratios is often available when infant mortality rates and various economic indicators are not.   

However, the infant sex ratio (SR1, henceforth) also reflects gendered social practices (environment, for biologists), which discriminate against girls.^[We cannot find any populations with gender-based discrimination against males, so we note but ignore the possibility that low infant sex ratios reflect discrimination against males in an otherwise healthy population.] Those practices push up infant and child sex ratios; and post-ultra-sound, they push up the sex ratio at birth. Given the ubiquity of discimination against girls, when we observe a low infant sex-ratio, we can conclude that maternal/infant health conditions were poor. However, apparently healthy child sex-ratios could instead could result from mortal misogyny in the context of deletious living conditions.^The infant sex-ratio in Punjab in 1891 was 103, apparently healthy for the time, However, the sex ratio of children aged 5-9 was 118. Our understanding is that female-infanticide, not good conditions, explain the “healthy” SR1. For further exposition see below]
When comparing across societies, we must take into account differences in sex-discrimination as well as possible differences in living standards. And so, there is a sense in which infant sex-ratios offer a _one-sided_ test of infant and maternal misery, because biologically normal sex-ratios may result from a healthy population or from sex-discrimination against girls. When comparing across societies, we must take into account differences in sex-discrimination as well as possible differences in living standards.  BUT WE KNOW THE DIRECTION OF BIAS     ... and now, Jim is done for the day ... 






Consider figure 1, which plots infant mortality against the SR1 on the country level. Below the biologically normal SRB (105.7, represented by a black line), there is a clear, negative relationship between SR1 and infant mortality. For high sex-ratios, we see a weak, positive relationship. Moreover, the bottom-left corner of the figure is empty, which points to the one-sidedness of the measure. If a low SR1, then high infant-mortality. For high SR1's, there is no such relationship. If a high SR1, infant mortality could be high or low.



Sources and notes. Each point is the unweighted average by country across years of SR1 and infant mortality, but the relationship is quite stable across different weightings.
