# Introduction

The infant sex ratio (SR1) is an important population-level dimension of maternal and infant health (physical and mental), and sex ratios among infants and children in a population have great potential as indicators of well-being of mothers and children (two groups for whom other measures of health and welfare are often lacking).^[As discussed below, high values of child sex ratios are familiar from social science research on "missing girls". Our attention to *low* sex ratios among infant and children is an extension of recent research on the sex ratio at birth (SRB) as a population-level health indicator: e.g. James and Grech (2018), Grech and Masukume (2016). Earlier work identified reductions in the SBR as a result of stressful events (floods, earthquakes, severe family health events, and the 9-11 attacks: see Lyster (1965); Fukuda et al. (1998); Hansen, MÃ¸ller, and Olsen (1999); Catalano et al. (2005)). ] The sex ratio at birth (SRB) in a healthy population tends towards 106 males per 100 females, but decreases with maternal stress.^[For a healthy SRB of 106 see e.g. Maconochie and Roman (1997), who report a SRB of 1.058 in over 1/2 million births in Scotland for the period 1975-1988. For the SRB decreasing with maternal stress, see e.g. West and Grech (2020). See also James and Grech (2017), on the considerable debate over precise mechanisms and evolutionary implications, because of which the SRB "remains one of the most longstanding unresolved problems in the biological sciences" (2017:50).] And on biological grounds, the infant sex ratio (SR1) falls as mortality rises, because infant mortality tends to be relatively greater among males than females.^[See e.g. Waldron (1983:324-25). See also Hammoud (1965). An early and convenient statement of male-biased infant and child mortality is offered in the 1861 Census of Scotland: "At birth 106 males appear for every 100 females ...; yet, by the law of nature, -- a law seen in still more powerful operation even in intra uterine life -- the tendency to succumb under disease is so much greater in the male than in the female, that by about the 18th year of life the proportion of the sexes becomes equalized, 100 males being alive at that age for every 100 females".] Absent sex-based differences in nutrition and care, deleterious living conditions for pregnant women, infants, and nursing mothers in a population will be reflected in low ratios of boys to girls -- at birth, in infancy, and among children.^[Although female-biased mortality is a possibility for a few diseases (Garenne and Lafon 1986:176), on the whole it seems clear that it requires sex-based discrimination against girls in nutrition and care to generate a rising sex ratio in a population (where the population is large enough that random fluctuations in the sex ratio cancel out).] Elevated child sex ratios have been a focus of attention in social science research pursuing Sen's (1990, 1992) insights on the problem of "missing women" in the context of mortal misogyny, but depressed child sex ratios are simpler indicators of deleterious conditions of life for pregnant women and nursing children. Of particular importance for research on historical populations, evidence on infant and child sex ratios is often available when infant mortality rates and various economic indicators are not.   

However, the infant sex ratio (SR1, henceforth) can also reflect gendered social practices (environment, for biologists), which discriminate against girls.^[We cannot find any populations with gender-based discrimination against males, so we note but ignore the possibility that low infant sex ratios could reflect discrimination against males in an otherwise healthy population.] When frequent and severe enough, such practices amount to mortal misogyny, which pushes up infant and child sex ratios.^[Post-ultra-sound, misogyny may be reflected in an elevated sex ratio at birth.] Given the ubiquity of discimination against girls, when we observe a low infant sex-ratio, we can conclude simply that maternal/infant health conditions were poor. However, apparently healthy child sex ratios could result from mortal misogyny in the context of deleterious living conditions.^[For example, consider the Punjab province of British-ruled India in 1891. The infant sex ratio there was 103, a healthy-looking value for the time. However, the child sex ratios were 108.0 for children aged 1-5 and 118.4 for those aged 5-9. Our understanding is that female infanticide, and not favorable living conditions, is the source of the healthy-looking SR1. More generally, the pattern of dramatically increasing sex-ratios with age is evidence of misogynistic gender-discrimination. Further to this point, see [below](#missing), and our discussion of [Sex-ratios and Missing Girls](sex_discr.html)] Because female infanticide and other forms of mortal misogyny will inflate infant and child sex ratios, the ratios offer a one-sided test of infant and maternal misery. Low infant sex ratios are a strong signal of poor living conditions for infants and mothers. But healthy-looking sex ratios could reflect a combination of poor living conditions and mortal misogyny. When comparing across societies, we must be alert for the potential role of sex-discrimination when interpreting sex-ratio data. 

To make an initial case for the value of the infant sex ratio as a measure of living conditions, consider figure 1, plotting infant mortality against the SR1 on the country level. Below the biologically normal SRB (105.7, represented by a black line), there is a clear, negative relationship between SR1 and infant mortality.^[Note that at low levels of infant mortality, the female survival advantage will have a negligible impact, and the SRB and SR1 will be about the same] Of particular importance, the bottom-left corner of the figure is empty, which points to the one-sidedness of the measure. If a low SR1, then high infant-mortality. For high SR1's, there is no such relationship. If a high SR1, infant mortality could be high or low. More generally, the plot of infant mortality against the SR1 illustrates the value of low levels of the SR1 as a signal of deleterious living conditions. 



Sources and notes. Each point is the unweighted average by country across years of SR1 and infant mortality, but the relationship is quite stable across different weightings.
