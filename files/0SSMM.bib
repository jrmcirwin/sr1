We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

In the case of eight CIS countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia plus Romania, the evidence is strongest, not least because surveys that allow independent estimation of infant mortality have been carried out there. In the case of the remaining six countries, the evidence is more circumstantial, and based on inconsistencies within the official data themselves, combined with information on how live births are defined. However, we find also that surveys are rather blunt instruments, and that the confidence intervals that surround estimates from these surveys are often large.},

  abstract = {Background
Under natural circumstances, the sex ratio of male to female mortality up to the age of 5 years is greater than one but sex discrimination can change sex ratios. The estimation of mortality by sex and identification of countries with outlying levels is challenging because of issues with data availability and quality, and because sex ratios might vary naturally based on differences in mortality levels and associated cause of death distributions.
Methods
For this systematic analysis, we estimated country-specific mortality sex ratios for infants, children aged 1\textendash 4 years, and children under the age of 5 years (under 5s) for all countries from 1990 (or the earliest year of data collection) to 2012 using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model, accounting for various data quality issues and assessing the uncertainty in sex ratios. We simultaneously estimated the global relation between sex ratios and mortality levels and constructed estimates of expected and excess female mortality rates to identify countries with outlying sex ratios.
Findings
Global sex ratios in 2012 were 1{$\cdot$}13 (90\% uncertainty interval 1{$\cdot$}12\textendash 1{$\cdot$}15) for infants, 0{$\cdot$}95 (0{$\cdot$}93\textendash 0{$\cdot$}97) for children aged 1\textendash 5 years, and 1{$\cdot$}08 (1{$\cdot$}07\textendash 1{$\cdot$}09) for under 5s, an increase since 1990 of 0{$\cdot$}01 (-0{$\cdot$}01 to 0{$\cdot$}02) for infants, 0{$\cdot$}04 (0{$\cdot$}02 to 0{$\cdot$}06) for children aged 1\textendash 4 years, and 0{$\cdot$}02 (0{$\cdot$}01 to 0{$\cdot$}04) for under 5s. Levels and trends varied across regions and countries. Sex ratios were lowest in southern Asia for 1990 and 2012 for all age groups. Highest sex ratios were seen in developed regions and the Caucasus and central Asia region. Decreasing mortality was associated with increasing sex ratios, except at very low infant mortality, where sex ratios decreased with total mortality. For 2012, we identified 15 countries with outlying under-5 sex ratios, of which ten countries had female mortality higher than expected (Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Jordan, Nepal, and Pakistan). Although excess female mortality has decreased since 1990 for the vast majority of countries with outlying sex ratios, the ratios of estimated to expected female mortality did not change substantially for most countries, and worsened for India.
Interpretation
Important differences exist between boys and girls with respect to survival up to the age of 5 years. Survival chances tend to improve more rapidly for girls compared with boys as total mortality decreases, with a reversal of this trend at very low infant mortality. For many countries, sex ratios follow this pattern but important exceptions exist. An explanation needs to be sought for selected countries with outlying sex ratios and action should be undertaken if sex discrimination is present.

  abstract = {Historically, women have lived longer than men in almost every country in the world. A similar pattern of sex differences in longevity is also found in many other species; however, it is not clear if there are more species in which females live longer or vice versa. For virtually all the primary causes of death and at virtually all ages, mortality rates are higher for men. Women do not live longer than men because they age more slowly, but because they are more robust at every age. Paradoxically, although women have lower mortality rates they have higher overall rates of physical illness than do men. Several hypotheses have been proposed for sex differences in longevity, including more active female immune functioning, the protective effect of estrogen, compensatory effects of the second X chromosome, reduction in the activity of growth hormone and the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling cascade, and the influence of oxidative stress on aging and disease. At present, none of these hypotheses are strongly supported, although weak support is available for the oxidative stress hypothesis. With the advent of more rapid genome sequencing, molecular tools will become available for more species, thus further detailing the causes for the differences in longevity between the sexes.},

Rather than female infanticide or other type of extreme violence against girls, these results might be explained by gender discrimination in terms of an unequal allocation of food, care and/or workload within the household. In high-mortality environments, this type of discrimination easily resulted in higher female mortality rates.},

Trivers \& Willard (1973, Science, 179, 90\textendash 92) suggested that the physical condition of the mother may influence whether she maximizes her lifetime reproductive success by biasing her investment towards sons or towards daughters. In this review I discuss the evidence for sex-biased maternal investment in primates. No consistent pattern emerges from data sets on sex differences in infant birth weights and growth rates, measures of nipple contact, and lengths of interbirth intervals with respect to maternal condition. Studies on birth sex ratios have also proven highly inconsistent. To test the Trivers \& Willard hypothesis, information on birth sex ratios, sex-biased mortality before and after birth, and patterns of maternal care during prenatal and postnatal life are required in a single population. Currently, no such information is available for any one population of primates, and will be difficult to obtain, owing to the long life span and complexity of social interactions of primates. An additional difficulty of testing the Trivers \& Willard hypothesis in primates is that it is hard to conceive of any empirical evidence that would disprove it as long as alternative adaptive explanations continue to be suggested for particular species and populations. A lack of correlation between maternal condition, birth sex ratio and maternal care could be interpreted as suggesting that additional factors have been overlooked. Direct predictions from the theory are required.},

We contend, based on extensive literature concerned with selection in utero, that this assumption remains questionable. At least a third and likely many more of human conceptions fail to yield a live birth. Those that survive to birth, moreover, do not represent their conception cohort. Increasing data availability has led to an improved understanding of selection in utero and its implications for population health. The literature describing selection in utero, however, receives relatively little attention from social scientists. We aim to draw attention to the rich theoretical and empirical literature on selection in utero by offering a typology that organizes this diverse work along dimensions we think important, if not familiar, to those studying population health. We further use the typology to identify important gaps in the literature. This work should interest social scientists for two reasons. First, phenomena of broad scholarly interest (i.e., social connectivity, bereavement) affect the extent and timing of selection in utero. Second, the life-course health of a cohort depends in part on the strength of such selection. We conclude by identifying new research directions and with a reconciliation of the apparent contradiction between the ``fetal origins'' literature and that describing selection in utero.},

We also know that low levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (i.e., hCG) measured in the serum of pregnant women predict fetal death. We do not, however, know whether male survivors of conception cohorts subjected to contracting economies exhibit, as theory predicts, higher hCG than those from other cohorts. We show, in 71 monthly conception cohorts including nearly two million California births, that they do. We thereby add to the literature suggesting that the economy, a phenomenon over which we collectively exercise at least some control, affects population health.

  abstract = {Objectives Controversy remains over whether declines in male births reported after population stressors result from either or both reduced conception of males or increased selection in utero against male fetuses. We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

We argue that expanding the work to include other outcomes could contribute to basic science. As an example, we use the response to mass layoffs to discriminate between two explanations of low ratios of male to female live births in stressed populations. One explanation asserts that ambient stressors reduce the ratio of males to females conceived. The other argues that the maternal stress response selects against males in utero. We show that selection in utero better explains the observed data. We conclude that human adaptation to the economic environment deserves scrutiny from a wider array of scientists than it now receives. Am. J. Hum.

  abstract = {The `DOHaD' literature argues that stressors encountered at age t `program' individual health at age t+n, and that this programming appears strongest when t defines critical developmental periods including gestation. Accordingly, children of ill-nourished pregnant women suffer greater later life morbidity than do offspring of well-nourished mothers. The possibility that circumstances other than access to nutritious food drive both a mother's diet and fetal development remains, however, a threat to the inference of programming in utero. Attempts to rule out this threat include tests of the hypothesis that birth cohorts in gestation during famines exhibit shorter life spans than other cohorts. The tests produce conflicting results attributed to confounding by autocorrelation, selective migration and introduction of modern medicine. We offer a test in which neither medicine nor migration nor autocorrelation could obscure the presumed effect. We apply time-series regression methods to the life span of Swedes born between 1751 and 1800 to test the hypothesis that cohorts exposed in utero to the Swedish Famine of 1773 lived shorter lives than expected from trends and other forms of autocorrelation. We use these 50 birth cohorts not only because they included those exposed to severe famine but also because they may well be the only human birth cohorts that completed life unaffected by selective migration and unaided by modern medicine and for which we know life span. We find that the cohort born in 1773 live 4.2 years longer than expected from trends over the last half of the 18th century.},

However, the timing and causes of the decline are still poorly understood. While some scholars attribute it to general improvements in living standards, others emphasize the role of social intervention and public health reforms. Written by specialists from several disciplinary fields, the twelve essays in this book break entirely new ground by providing a long-term perspective that challenges some deep-rooted ideas about the European experience of mortality decline and may help explain the forces and causal relationships behind the still tragic incidence of preventable infant and child deaths in many parts of the world today. This book will become a standard work for students and researchers in demography, social and economic history, population geography, and the history of medicine, and it will be of interest to anyone concerned with current debates on the policies to be adopted to curb infant and child mortality in both developed and developing countries.},

We contribute to this debate by investigating the impact of social capital on self-reported health for eight countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States. We rely on three indicators of social capital at the individual level (trust, participation in local organisations, social isolation) and employ alternative procedures to estimate consistently the impact of social capital on health. The three social capital indicators are choice variables and are hence, by definition, endogenously determined. We attempt to circumvent the endogeneity problems by using instrumental variable estimates. Our results show that the individual degree of trust is positively and significantly correlated with health, this being true with least squares estimators as well as when relying on instrumental variable estimators with (and without) community fixed effects. Similarly, social isolation is negatively and significantly associated with health, irrespective of the procedure of estimation. On the other hand, the effect of being a member of a Putnamesque organisation is more ambiguous and usually not significantly related to health.

Our analysis of 15 developed countries shows that, as infant mortality declined over two centuries, the excess male mortality increased from 10\% in 1751 to {$>$}30\% by approximately 1970. Remarkably, since 1970, the male disadvantage in most countries fell back to lower levels. The worsening male disadvantage from 1751 until 1970 may be due to differential changes in cause-specific infant mortality by sex. Declines in infant mortality from infections and the shift of deaths to perinatal conditions favored females. The reduction in male excess infant mortality after 1970 can be attributed to improved obstetric practices and neonatal care. The additional male infants who survived because of better conditions were more likely to be premature or have low birth weight, which could have implications for their health in later life. This analysis provides evidence of marked changes in the sex ratio of mortality at an age when behavioral differences should be minimal.},

Analyzing data from demographic surveys carried out around 2005, we confirm the persistence of high sex ratios in these three countries and document significant differences in fertility intentions and behavior according to the sex of the previous child or children that constitute evidence of the practice of sex-selective abortion. These countries combine societal features and medical systems that make this phenomenon possible: son preference in a context of low fertility and the possibility of prenatal sex selection given easy access to ultrasound screening and induced abortion. Why high sex ratios are observed only in these three countries of the sub-region remains, however, an open question.},

Unfortunately, U.S. infant mortality rates prior to 1950 suffer from an upward bias stemming from a severe underregistration of births. At one extreme, African American births in southern states went unregistered at the rate of 15\% to 25\%. In this study, we construct improved estimates of births and infant mortality in the United States for 1915-1940 using recently released complete count decennial census microdata combined with the counts of infant deaths from published sources. We check the veracity of our estimates with a major birth registration study completed in conjunction with the 1940 decennial census and find that the largest adjustments occur in states with less-complete birth registration systems. An additional advantage of our census-based estimation method is the extension backward of the birth and infant mortality series for years prior to published estimates of registered births, enabling previously impossible comparisons and estimations. Finally, we show that underregistration can bias effect estimates even in a panel setting with specifications that include location fixed effects and place-specific linear time trends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDMost Romani groups in Europe have experienced a decline in childhood mortality during recent decades. These crucial transformations are rarely addressed in research or public policy. OBJECTIVEThis paper analyzes the timing and structure of the decline of childhood mortality among the Gitano people of Spain. METHODSThe paper is based on the family and genealogy reconstitution of the Gitano population of 22 contiguous localities in Southern Spain. Registry data from over 19,100 people and 3,501 reconstituted families was included in a dense genealogical grid ranging over 150 years. From this database we produced annual time series of infant and child mortality and of the registered causes of death from 1871 to 2005. RESULTSThe analyzed data shows a rapid decline in infant and child mortality from about 1949 to 1970. The onset of the definitive decline occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Child mortality was higher in the pre-transitional period and started to decline earlier, although it took longer to converge with majority rates. The mortality transition in the Gitano minority paralleled that of the dominant majority, but with important delays and higher mortality rates. The causes of death show the deprivation suffered by Gitano people. CONCLUSIONSThe childhood mortality decline facilitated the most important changes experienced recently by the Gitano minority, including its fertility transition and the transformation of Gitanos' gender and family systems. CONTRIBUTIONThis is one of the first historical reconstructions of the mortality transition of a Romani population.},

The results showed very high values by any standard, with an average of 108.4 for a sample of some 8.2 million births, with somewhat lower values in urban areas. Analysis of socioeconomic correlates revealed that the sex ratio varied very much by household wealth, from about 110 for very poor women to about 102 for wealthier women. The high value of the sex ratio at birth in Ethiopia could be explained by poverty, used as a proxy for poor nutritional status. In multivariate analysis, the effects of living in urban areas and of maternal education were less important than household wealth. Among the many ethno-linguistic groups, the Nilotic family had higher sex ratios than other groups. The results were confirmed using data from DHS surveys conducted in the country, and by the analysis of children still living at time of census.},

  abstract = {SEXIST DISEASES MICHEL GARENNE* and MONIQUE LAEONf Introduction In human populations, females usually have a lower mortality than males at any age. This pattern is observed for most causes of death due to chronic diseases, accidents, and violence [1-4]. However, lower female mortality is not universal, and a reverse pattern of excess female mortality has been observed for some infectious diseases. Whooping cough is often quoted in the medical literature as being more lethal for girls than for boys [5] . Another such recently documented disease is measles [6]. Both are airborne diseases for which the incidence is virtually identical for males and females. This implies that differences in mortality demonstrate a difference in case fatality. The excess female mortality from measles and whooping cough is found throughout the world, in places as different as Europe,Japan, North America, Africa, and Latin America. This implies a biological difference rather than a cultural pattern, and therefore a higher susceptibility for females . In casual reports made throughout the world, and especial!)' among older children and young adults, excess female mortality has been observed in certain other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, typhoid and paratyphoid , typhus, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, influenza, and congenital syphilis [7-9]. The two striking features of these early studies are the highly selective list of diseases exhibiting excess female mortality and the changing pattern by age. Late childhood and early adulthood appear to be the life periods when females are the most vulnerable compared to males. The explanation for a higher vulnerability of females for certain infectious diseases could be sought in differences between the male and female The authors would like to thank Prof. Samuel Preston (University of Pennsylvania) and Dr. Brian Ward (McGiIl University) for comments on the demographic and immunologic aspects of the manuscript; Dr. Desmond Martin (National Institute for Virology, South Africa) for personal communications on various diseases; and Ms. Shelah Bhalti (Harvard University) for editorial comments. * Centre Francais sur la Population et le D\'eveloppement (CEPED), 15 rue de l'Ecole de M\'edecine, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France. f Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Docteur Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.\textcopyright{} 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Recently, lymphocytes have been divided into two subsets, Th-I and Th-2, according to the cytokines they produce [10, H]. Th-I are major producers of IL-2, and IFN-?, whereas Th-2 produce high levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-IO. Stimulation of Th-2 lymphocytes activates antibody secretion, whereas stimulation of Th-I lymphocytes facilitates cytotoxic T cells. The balance between Th-I and Th-2 responses seems to be essential for resistance to disease and survival. Recently, evidence accumulated showing that male and female immune systems do not mount immune responses in the same way [12]. Females seem to favor a Th-2 response , whereas males favor a Th-I response. This is especially true during pregnancy, when there is a drop of Th-I cytokines and an increase of Th-2 cytokines [13, 14]. The fact that sex hormones can regulate the Th-I/ Th-2 balance [15, 16] could explain the differences between male and female mortality for certain infectious diseases, especially among young adults when the level of sex hormones is the highest. The goals of this study were (1) to systematically search for groups of infectious diseases showing different male and female mortality during late childhood and early adulthood, (2) to investigate the characteristics of the Th-I and Th-2 responses to certain infectious diseases, and (3) to test the plausibility of the sex hormones explanation. This hypothesis linking the hormonal and the immunological systems and the way the body copes with infectious diseases could explain both the direction and the changing pattern of gender differences in mortality by age. Demographic Evidence The demographic data originated from the World Health Statistics, a databank computerized by the World Health Organization from national causes of death statistics. Data originated from 110 countries throughout the world between 1950 and 1989. These were mostly developed...},

Despite arguments about its relevance, uniform measurement of infant mortality is necessary to guarantee its use as a valid measure of population health. Using important socioeconomic indicators, we develop a novel method to adjust country-specific reported infant mortality figures that may misrepresent development within a country. We conclude that an ``augmented'' measure of mortality that includes both infant and late fetal deaths should be considered when assessing levels of social welfare in a country. Also, mortality statistics that exhibit a substantially high ratio of late fetal to early neonatal deaths should be more closely scrutinized.},

Some authors have even proposed warfare as a factor influencing live birth sex ratios. The hypothesis that during and shortly after periods of war the human secondary sex ratio is higher has received little statistical treatment. In this paper we evaluate the war hypothesis using 3 statistical methods: linear regression, randomization, and time-series analysis. Live birth data from 10 different countries were included. Although we cannot speak of a general phenomenon, statistical evidence for an association between warfare and live birth sex ratio was found for several countries. Regression and randomization test results were in agreement. Time-series analysis showed that most human sex-ratio time series can be described by a common model. The results obtained using intervention models differed somewhat from results obtained by regression methods.},

Also, Kyrgyzstan's mortality fluctuations have had smaller amplitude. This has occurred in spite of worse macro-economic outcomes in Kyrgyzstan. To understand these surprising patterns, we analyzed cause-specific mortality in Kyrgyzstan vs. Russia for the period 1981-2010, using unpublished official data. We find that, as in Russia, fluctuations in Kyrgyzstan have been primarily due to changes in external causes and circulatory causes, and alcohol appears to play an important role. However, in contrast with Russia, mortality from these causes in Kyrgyzstan has been lower and has increased by a smaller amount. As a result, the mortality gap between the two countries is overwhelmingly attributable to external and cardio-vascular causes, and more generally, to causes that have been shown to be strongly related to alcohol consumption. These cause-specific results, together with the existence of large ethnic differentials in mortality in Kyrgyzstan, highlight the importance of cultural and religious differences, and their impact on patterns of alcohol consumption, in explaining the mortality gap between the two countries. These findings show that explanatory frameworks relying solely on macro-economic factors are not sufficient for understanding differences in mortality levels and trends among former Soviet republics.},

  abstract = {Introduction Irish Travellers are a nomadic minority group on the island of Ireland (IOI). The All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010) showed inequalities in socioeconomic and health indicators. The infant mortality rate (IMR) in 1987 was 18.1 (95\% CI 10.9 to 25.3) per 1000 births, one of the highest in Europe. The aim of this study was to calculate the IMR, neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and postneonatal mortality rate (PNMR) for Ireland Travellers, to compare with the general Irish population, and to describe major causes of death.
Methodology The Traveller birth cohort study comprises all Traveller babies born between 14 October 2008 and 13 October 2009 (n=986) on IOI and followed up over 1 year. Cohort ascertainment strategies to estimate infant mortality included data collected through public health nurses (PHNs), Traveller health projects (THPs), mass media such as parish newsletter and Traveller-specific social magazines. A comprehensive search for death certificates was performed in the General Register Office with confirmation of Traveller status sought from PHNs/THPs.
Results 12 infant deaths were identified in IOI based on cohort period, including 1 death from Northern Ireland. Some deaths were not officially registered. Using capture-recapture technique, an estimated true range of infant deaths was calculated as 10 to 15 cases. Congenital anomalies (n=5), preterm births (n=2), metabolic diseases (n=4) and accidents (n=1) are the leading causes of death. The cohort IMR for ROI Travellers was 12.0 (95\% CI 5.5 to 19.7), 3.7 times the general population IMR 3.2 (92\% CI 3.22 to 3.24) and 2.7 times the European average in 2008. The ROI Traveller NMR was 5.4 (95\% CI 5.3 to 5.6), almost twice the 2008 European average, compared to 2.27 (95\% CI 2.26 to 2.29) for the general Irish population and 14.4 (95\% CI 14.1 to 14.7) for Travellers in 1987. PNMR increased by 180\% from 3.6 (95\% CI 3.4 to 3.8) in 1987 to 6.5 (95\% CI 6.4 to 6.7) in 2009; for general Irish population in 2009, the PNMR was 0.95 (95\% CI 0.95 to 0.96).
Conclusion There has been some improvement in Traveller infant mortality over two decades, however the greater improvement in the general population results in a widening gap. Improvement in neonatal care has shifted previous neonatal deaths to the postneonatal period. The raised infant mortality is not associated with factors related to adverse social conditions, a positive finding.},

Human sex ratio at birth at the population level has been suggested to vary according to exogenous stressors such as wars, ambient temperature, ecological disasters and economic crises, but their relative effects on birth sex ratio have not been investigated. It also remains unclear whether such associations represent environmental forcing or adaptive parental response, as parents may produce the sex that has better survival prospects and fitness in a given environmental challenge. 2. We examined the simultaneous role of wars, famine, ambient temperature, economic development and total mortality rate on the annual variation of offspring birth sex ratio and whether this variation, in turn, was related to sex-specific infant mortality rate in Finland during 1865\textendash 2003. 3. Our findings show an increased excess of male births during the World War II and during warm years. Instead, economic development, famine, short-lasting Finnish civil war and total mortality rate were not related to birth sex ratio. Moreover, we found no association between annual birth sex ratio and sex-biased infant mortality rate among the concurrent cohort. 4. Our results propose that some exogenous challenges like ambient temperature and war can skew human birth sex ratio and that these deviations likely represent environmental forcing rather than adaptive parental response to such challenges.},

Together with precise measures of Paul Bunyan's hips, waist, shoulders, thighs, calves, and reach, subsequently detailed, we would, it seems, have a rather comprehensive anthropometric description of this legendary logger. But his companion, Babe the Blue Ox, ``was seven axe handles wide between the eyes,'' quite a different anthropometric measure indeed. Moreover, ``some persons give the measurement as forty-two axe handles and a plug of Star tobacco.'' And, we are told, ``both figures are correct,'' all of which quickly brings us to the heart of the problem, species aside.},

However, policy intervention in the form of the Old Poor Law blocked the transmission of poverty and avoided permanent pauperism.

Due to the synergism between undernutrition and many infectious diseases, the food proscriptions may contribute to greater morbidity and mortality among young children in populations which adhere to them. Therefore writers describing these traditional child feeding practices have often recommended intervention by health workers, particularly nutrition education programs emphasizing the dangers to child health.},

  abstract = {The degree to which biological factors contribute to the existence and the widening of mortality differences by sex remains unclear. To address this question, a mortality analysis for the years 1890 to 1995 was performed comparing mortality data on more than 11,000 Catholic nuns and monks in Bavarian communities living in very nearly identical behavioral and environmental conditions with life table data for the general German population. While the mortality differences between women and men in the general German population increased considerably after World War II, they remained almost constant among the members of Bavarian religious orders during the entire observation period, with slight advantages for nuns. Thus, the higher differences observable in the general population cannot be attributed to biological factors. The different trends in sex-specific mortality between the general and the cloistered populations are caused exclusively by men in the general population who were unable to follow the trend in mortality reduction of women, nuns, and especially monks. Under the special environmental conditions of nuns and monks, biological factors appear to confer a maximum survival advantage for women of no more than one year in remaining life expectancy at young adult ages.},

Direct observation and census data suggested that gender ratios deviated sufficiently from what is known to be normal in modern human populations to suggest that the phenomenon was not random. Researchers have explored major proximate causes of ``missing'' girls and women such as female-selective abortion, routine neglect of young girls in their families including differential access to modern medical care, and even infanticide. This article uses Sen's work and the research of others on Asia to compare with evidence of the disadvantaging or even ``mortal neglect'' of girls and women in Western European society in the early modern and modern periods \textemdash{} roughly from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. It argues that the current state of the evidence suggests little support for similar gender-specific forms of mortal neglect in Western Europe. It explores why this may have been so, using evidence from economic, social, demographic and religious life. \ding{73} The author would like to thank Amy Patterson for research and editorial help; and George Alter, Fabian Drixler, Joel Harrington, Satomi Kurosu, Donald Sutton, Frans van Poppel and an anonymous reader for the journal for their insightful comments and suggestions for revisions of a previous draft of this article.

Births and birth rates increased among all race and Hispanic-origin groups. Teen childbearing rose 3\% in 2006, to 41.9 per 1000 females aged 15 to 19 years, the first increase after 14 years of steady decline. Birth rates rose 2\% to 4\% for women aged 20 to 44; rates for the youngest (10\textendash 14 years) and oldest (45\textendash 49) women were unchanged. Childbearing by unmarried women increased steeply in 2006 and set new historic highs. The cesarean-delivery rate rose by 3\% in 2006 to 31.1\% of all births; this figure has been up 50\% over the last decade. Preterm and low birth weight rates also increased for 2006 to 12.8\% and 8.3\%, respectively. The 2005 infant mortality rate was 6.89 infant deaths per 1000 live births, not statistically higher than the 2004 level. Non-Hispanic black newborns continued to be more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants to die in the first year of life in 2004. For all gender and race groups combined, expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.9 years in 2005. Age-adjusted death rates in the United States continue to decline. The crude death rate for children aged 1 to 19 years decreased significantly between 2000 and 2005. Of the 10 leading causes of death for children in 2005, only the death rate for cerebrovascular disease was up slightly from 2000, whereas accident and chronic lower respiratory disease death rates decreased. A large proportion of childhood deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The limited scientific knowledge on relationship between exposure and health effects in relation to geothermal activity motivated an epidemiologic investigation in Tuscan geothermal area. The study aims to describe the health status of populations living in Tuscany municipalities where concessions for exploitation of geothermal resources were granted.
DESIGN: This is an ecological study, so it is not useful to produce evidence to sustain a judgment on the cause-effect link. The major limits of this type of study are the use of the residence at municipal level as a proxy of exposure to both environmental and socioeconomic factors and the use of aggregated data of health outcomes that can lead to the well-known ecological fallacy.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen municipalities were included in the study area: eight are part of the so-called "traditional" geothermal area, defined as Northern Geothermal Area (NGA) and eight located in the Amiata Mountain defined as Southern Geothermal Area (SGA). In 2000-2006, the average resident population in the overall area was approximately 43,000 inhabitants. Thirty-one geothermal power plants were active, with a production capacity of 811 MW, 5 of them with 88 MW located in the SGA. Statistical analyses on the entire geothermal area, NGA and SGA subareas, and the sixteen municipalities were performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality data were obtained from Tuscany Regional Mortality Registry for the 1971-2006 period, analysing 60 causes of death, of interest for population health status or consistent with "Project SENTIERI" criteria. Hospital discharge records of residents in Tuscany Region in 2004-2006, anywhere admitted to hospital, were analyzed considering only the main diagnosis, excluding repeated admissions for the same cause. The causes taken into account are the same analysed for mortality were considered. Age-standardized mortality rates (TSDM) and the temporal trends of TSDM for four periods (1971-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2006) were computed. Age-standardized mortality/hospitalization ratios (SMR/SHR), with and without adjustment for the deprivation index based on 2001 census data, were calculated: mortality in the years 2000-2006 and hospitalization in 2004-2006. The expected number of events were computed using rates of residents in neighbouring municipalities (municipalities included in 50 km radius circle centred on the study area). Bayesian estimates of mortality/hospitalization ratios (BMR/BHR) at municipal level only and relating maps of the Bayesian risk estimators were elaborated. Congenital malformations (MC) were analysed using data from Tuscan Registry of Birth Defect in 1992-2006 period, relative to outcomes of pregnancies in women resident in the municipalities of study area, wherever the birth or termination of pregnancy occurred. The ratio between observed and expected cases (O/A), with expected defined according to regional rate, were calculated and O/A Bayesian estimates (BMR) are showed only at municipal level. The low weight and the males/females ratio at birth were analysed using data from Tuscany Birth Certificates, covering period 2001-2007, excluding births occurred in facilities outside Tuscany Region. For Low birth weight ({$<$} 2,500 grams), very low birth weight ({$<$} 1,500 grams), low birth weight in women with normal gestational age or greater than 36 weeks, gestational age less than 36 weeks, and the frequency of males, the observed/expected ratio was calculated, with the expected number defined according to regional rate.
RESULTS: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND: High levels of arsenic in drinking water distribution emerges as a critical element, so that several municipalities resorted to granting exemptions for the parameters laid down by the Legislative Decree in force (D.Lgs 31/01). However, during the final phase of the study, new blast systems activated in the SGA decreased the arsenic levels in the water supply, reaching values not requiring derogations, which, instead, are still effective in some NGA municipalities. Air quality data, from Tuscany Regional Agency for Environmental Protection-ARPAT, show that geothermal activities are able to affect air quality, especially with hydrogen sulphide in NGA, and hydrogen sulphide and mercury in SGA. A significant contribution to the presence of mercury in air is due to previous metallurgical sites. Although mercury levels are below WHO guideline values, in SGA nearby Siena, values were significantly higher than in other geothermal areas, because of power plant PC2 (turned off in July 2011) in Piancastagnaio municipality. The hydrogen sulphide concentration levels were generally lower than WHO reference values, with occasional excesses over guideline value for health protection (150 \textmu g/m3 as average of the 24 hours). Olfactory pollution was more critic with values exceeding 7-10 \textmu g/m3 range even in areas without geothermal plants.
RESULTS: POPULATION'S HEALTH STATUS: This study evaluated health status of resident population in geothermal areas analysing geographic and temporal distribution of mortality, hospitalization and reproductive health outcomes (congenital malformations, low birth weight, sex ratio among newborns). In both geothermal areas mortality rates steadily declined from 1971 to 2006, in males and females, in line with the regional trends. In 2000-2006 period, in the overall geothermal area a significant mortality excess was observed for all causes among males (2,312 deaths, 2,146 expected), but not among females, using as reference residents in neighbouring municipalities. The mortality excess among males was more evident for infectious diseases (25 deaths, 10 expected), especially tuberculosis (8 deaths, 2 expected), for respiratory diseases (218 deaths, 170 expected), in particular pneumoconiosis, including deaths from silicosis (51 deaths, 14 expected), and for nervous system diseases (72 deaths, 56 expected). Among females significant mortality excess for liver cirrhosis (35 deaths, 25 expected) emerged, while mortality from cardiovascular diseases and ischemic heart diseases were significantly lower than expected. In the NGA, mortality among men was lower than expected for all cancers (-15\%), in particular for lung cancer (- 25\%), while values significantly in excesses were observed for infectious diseases (11 observed, 4 expected) and respiratory diseases (90 observed, 73 expected), expecially pneumoconiosis (20 observed, 6 expected). Among females, significant mortality excesses for ovarian cancer (17 observed, 10 expected) and for circulatory disorders of brain (170 observed, 140 expected) resulted. In the SGA, mortality was more critical, accounting for majority of the excesses detected in overall Geothermal Area. In fact, only infectious diseases and pneumoconiosis were detected in excess in both the geothermal areas. In the SGA, excess of general mortality among males (1,431 deaths; 1,245 expected) but not among females emerged. Even for all cancers, an excess among males (505 deaths, 419 expected) was observed, in particular for cancer of stomach (53 deaths, 44 expected, not statistically significant after adjusting for DI), liver (39 deaths, 23 expected) and lung (124 deaths, 102 expected) cancer. Mortality in SGA was also in excess for respiratory diseases only among men (128 deaths, 97 expected), mostly due to silicosis (31 deaths, 8 expected), although steadily decreasing since 1971 as observed at regional level. Also tuberculosis resulted in excess in SGA (7 deaths, 1 expected). Among females acute respiratory disease mortality was significantly in excess (41 observed, 29 expected). Temporal trend showed a decline from the 70s to the 90s, with a rising trend in recent years in line with Tuscany region. It should be considered that pneumonia was the commonest cause of death of acute respiratory diseases, which allow for lower reliability of death certificate, especially among the elderly ({$>$} 64 years). Among females resident in SGA a mortality excess from digestive system diseases was observed (72 observed, 55 expected). The hospitalization in the overall Geothermal Area did not show any excess for all causes and all tumours in both genders. Statistically significant excesses for hospital admission from stomach cancer among males (49 observed, 38 expected) and females (42 observed, 28 expected), and from lymphohematopoietic tumours among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (15 observed, 5 expected), were observed. As mortality analysis highlighted, also hospital admissions by geothermal areas and gender showed a worst picture in SGA than in NGA. In the latter, a significant excess of hospital admissions from all causes among females (1,357 observed, 1,284 expected) but not among males (1,193 observed, 1,141 expected) and an excess - close to statistical significance - from all tumours only among females (297 observed; 272 expected) were observed. Furthermore, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions from digestive system diseases in both genders (M: 392 observed, 350 expected; F: 300 observed, 268 expected), from dementias (16 observed, 8 expected) and from lympho hematopoietic cancers among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (9 observed, 2 expected), were observed. In the SGA, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for stomach cancer (M: 32 observed, 21 expected, not significant after adjusting by DI; F: 29 observed, 18 expected), for respiratory diseases (M: 408 observed, 351 expected; F: 339 observed, 277 expected) and for renal failure (M: 61 observed, 41 expected; F: 52 observed, 34 expected) were observed in both genders.

For mother cohorts born after 1972 and reaching adulthood in the early and mid-1990s, heights declined. Evidence on both the length and weight of babies corroborates this pattern as there is a noticeable connection between the height and weight of newborns and that of their mothers, on the one hand, and social and demographic indicators, on the other. In our data, we see their values trace a ``U'' shaped curve with troughs near the mid-1990s. Thus, the anthropometric evidence concerning newborns as well as mothers points to the impact of strains on living standards that were prevalent during the period of economic restructuring of the 1990s. This is a general result that confirms a recurring pattern: periods of economic transitions are almost always accompanied by biological stress. In the Soviet and post-Soviet periods, newborns in Moscow and St. Petersburg were definitely inferior to European and white American newborns in weight and, most likely, in stature as well, as there is a close relationship between stature and weight.},

It becomes more understandable, however, once it is realized that (a) lightning bolts are common in the region, causing considerable destruction and death, and (b) lightning, like certain other celestial phenomena such as a haze-covered sun, is interpreted by the Tarahumara as a sign of serious cosmic disruption.

Here, we motivate the importance of innovation in the characterization of fecundity, and prenatal selection in particular. We argue that such innovation is crucial for expanding knowledge of the fetal origins of later life health. Pregnancy loss is common, responsive to environmental factors, and closely related to maternal and fetal health outcomes. As a result, selection into live birth is driven by many of the same exposures that shape the health trajectories of survivors. Life course effects that are inferred without accounting for these dynamics may be significantly distorted by survival bias. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations with realistic parameters to examine the implications of prenatal survival bias. We find that even in conservatively specified scenarios, true fetal origin effects can be underestimated by 50\% or more. In contrast, effects of exposures that reduce the probability of prenatal survival but improve the health of survivors will be overestimated. The absolute magnitude of survival bias can even exceed small-effect sizes, resulting in inferences that beneficial exposures are harmful or vice versa. We also find reason for concern that moderately sized true effects, underestimated due to failure to account for selective survival, are missing from scientific knowledge because they do not clear statistical significance filters. This bias has potential real-world costs; policy decisions about interventions to improve maternal and infant health will be affected by underestimated program impact.},

This book is a study of one of the worst social evils, namely female infanticide which was prevalent among a section of Hindus in the present Uttar Pradesh and which was suppressed by the enforcement of social legislation spreading over nearly a century. Apart from tracing the growth of British social policy in India with reference to the practice of female infanticide, the study focuses attention on the complexities of the problems of social legislation and social reform in India. Significant changes in caste relationship and behaviour patterns occurred as a consequence of these processes.},

Until recently, excess male mortality was thought to be caused by biological and genetic differences between the sexes, with boys being biologically weaker and therefore more susceptible to premature death (Naeyeet al. 1971; Waldron 1998). In previously published research (Pongou 2013), I showed some limitations of this biological hypothesis and proposed the "preconception origins" hypothesis, which holds that some of the preconception and prenatal environmental factors that have been shown to determine the offspring sex ratio also explain the male-female difference in early-age mortality.},

These more comprehensive measures of population health, however, are more complex, and for resource poor countries, this added burden could mean diverting funds from much needed programmes. Unfortunately, the conjecture, that DALE is a better measure of population health than IMR, has not been empirically tested.
Methods: IMR and DALE data for 1997 were obtained from the World Bank and the World Health Organisation, respectively, for 180 countries.
Findings: There is a strong (generally) linear association between DALE and IMR (r=0.91). Countries with low DALE tend to have a high IMR. The countries with the lowest IMRs had DALEs above that predicted by the regression line.
Interpretation: There is little evidence that the use of IMR as a measure of population health has a negative impact on older groups in the population. IMR remains an important indicator of health for whole populations, reflecting the intuition that structural factors affecting the health of entire populations have an impact on the mortality rate of infants. For countries with limited resources that require an easily calculated, pithy measure of population health, IMR may remain a suitable choice.},

These moral evaluations are, in turn, influenced by such external contingencies as popula\- tion demography, social and economic factors, subsistence strategies, house\- hold composition, and by cultural ideas concerning the nature of infancy and childhood, definitions of personhood, and beliefs about the soul and its immortality. MOTHER LOVE AND CHILD DEATH Of all the many factors that endanger the lives of young children, by far the most difficult to examine with any degree of dispassionate objectivity is the quality of parenting. Historians and social scientists, no less than the public at large, are influenced by old cultural myths about childhood inno\- cence and mother love as well as their opposites. The terrible power and significance attributed to maternal behavior (in particular) is a commonsense perception based on the observation that the human infant (specialized as it is for prematurity and prolonged dependency) simply cannot survive for very long without considerable maternal love and care. The infant's life depends, to a very great extent, on the good will of others, but most especially, of course, that of the mother. Consequently, it has been the fate of mothers throughout history to appear in strange and distorted forms. They may appear as larger than life or as invisible; as all-powerful and destructive; or as helpless and angelic. Myths of the maternal instinct compete, historically, witli -myths of a universal infanticidal impulse.},

We demonstrate that the dramatic rise in infant mortality that occurred in the mid-1970s was accounted for in large part by an increase in death rates from causes which predominate after the first month of life, particularly in the Central Asian republics, but also in the more developed Baltic and European republics. Improvements in the classification of perinatal deaths do not appear to have played a significant role in explaining trends in reported infant mortality in the 1970s, but may have been responsible for some of the rise (or lack of decline) during the late 1980s. Despite the apparent improvements in the recording of deaths that occurred shortly after birth, there is evidence in several republics of substantial misclassification of early infant deaths as late fetal deaths as recently as 1990. Because such a pattern would lead to the omission of many infant deaths, it appears that infant mortality rates may have been understated in several of the less developed republics even at the end of the period studied.},

The absence of paternal transmission of such extranuclear components is thought to preclude a response to selection on their effects on male viability and fertility. We overturn this dogma by showing that two mechanisms, inbreeding and kin selection, allow mitochondria to respond to selection on both male viability and fertility. Even modest levels of inbreeding allow such a response to selection when there are direct fitness effects of mitochondria on male fertility because inbreeding associates male fertility traits with mitochondrial matrilines. Male viability effects of mitochondria are also selectable whenever there are indirect fitness effects of males on the fitness of their sisters. When either of these effects is sufficiently strong, we show that there are conditions that allow the spread of mitochondria with direct effects that are harmful to females, contrary to standard expectation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of organelles and endosymbionts and genomic conflict.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews evidence concerning genetic factors that influence sex differences in human mortality, with attention to the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Some widely quoted earlier conclusions, for example, that males have consistently higher fetal mortality than females, are not supported by current evidence. For example, for late fetal mortality, males had higher rates than females in earlier historical data, but not in recent data for several advanced industrial countries. This reflects a changing balance between an inherently greater female vulnerability for one major type of late fetal mortality and inherently greater male vulnerability for several other types of late fetal mortality that have declined in importance as health care has improved. Males appear to be inherently more vulnerable than females to infant mortality, although the causes of this vulnerability are poorly understood. X-linked immunoregulatory genes appear to contribute to greater female resistance to infectious diseases. Despite these apparent inherent advantages for females, in some situations females have had higher infant mortality and higher infectious disease mortality than males, apparently due to environmental disadvantages for females, such as less adequate diet and health care. Inherent sex differences in reproductive physiology and anatomy contribute to higher female mortality for breast cancer and maternal mortality. For these causes of death, as for the other categories discussed, the death rates and thus the contributions to sex differences in total mortality vary considerably depending on environmental conditions. Several hypothesized contributions of sex hormones to sex differences in mortality are at present controversial due to contradictions and limitations in the available data. There may be effects of male sex hormones on sex differences in behavior which contribute to males' higher death rates for accidents and other violent causes. Women's endogenous sex hormones may reduce women's risk of ischemic heart disease. For both violent deaths and ischemic heart disease it appears that any genetic contributions to sex differences in mortality are strongly reinforced by the cultural influences that foster more risky behavior in males, including more use of weapons, employment in hazardous occupations, heavy alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. It appears that these cultural influences on sex differences in behavior are widespread cross-culturally in part because of the effects of inherent sex differences in reproductive functions on the cultural evolution of sex roles. These examples illustrate the complexity and importance of interactions between genetic and environmental factors in determining sex differences in human mortality.},

  abstract = {The objective of these analyses was to estimate the strength and direction of secular trends in adult height and childhood socioeconomic circumstances in eight towns in three Eastern European countries in the mid-20th century, and to assess the extent to which childhood conditions might explain the height differences. We used cross-sectional data from the baseline survey of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study, conducted in 2002\textendash 2005. The study examined 24,012 men and women born between 1933 and 1957, randomly selected from the general populations of Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland) and six towns of the Czech Republic. To allow for age-related height loss we estimated maximum attained height. Parental education and household item ownership at age 10 were used as markers of childhood socioeconomic conditions. In all 5-year birth cohorts, Novosibirsk men and women were shortest. There were positive and statistically significant secular trends in childhood conditions and in maximum adult height. Adjustment for childhood conditions explained about one third of the trend in height. There appeared to be a small reduction in height of persons born during the Second World War which was, however, only significant in Novosibirsk. These results suggest that secular trends in height mirror, but are not wholly explained by, trends in socioeconomic circumstances in early life.},

  abstract = {Assessing the change in the level of Soviet welfare in the first half of the twentieth century presents many problems. There are the problems associated with the reliability and accessibility of Soviet statistics, and there are those associated with the problem of understanding the peculiar nature of the Soviet situation in which a trend toward rapid secular improvements in welfare and life expectancy were accompanied by massive shortterm welfare and mortality crises. These problems are made even more complicated by the intense politicization of this question. In this paper I address all of these problems.},

  abstract = {The ratio of the sexes at birth is remarkably constant for various countries over long periods of time for populations as a whole. Data are presented to show that the sex-ratio at conception is significantly higher than sex-ratio at birth. The lesser percentage of males at birth than at conception is accounted for by a differential prenatal mortality bearing more heavily upon the male fetus than upon the female fetus. Thus the sex-ratio at birth is a function of the sex-ratio at conception and the sex-ratio of intrauterine mortality. Various lines of approach are utilized to prove that social factors affect the amount of prenatal mortality and finally the sex-ratio at birth. A group of 5,466 completed families, forming a "higher" social class, are utilized to test the general hypothesis. They show a significantly higher sex-ratio at birth than does the general population. The conclusion is reached that more desirable social environments are important factors tending to raise the sex-ratio at birth. As such environments become more general, they will operate in the direction of a higher proportion of male births.},
