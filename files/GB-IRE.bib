We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

There are worrying indications that official infant mortality counts, based on administrative data, may understate the true gravity of the problem in 15 countries in the region, including 11 out of 12 CIS countries, and 4 countries in South Eastern Europe. In the case of eight CIS countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia plus Romania, the evidence is strongest, not least because surveys that allow independent estimation of infant mortality have been carried out there. In the case of the remaining six countries, the evidence is more circumstantial, and based on inconsistencies within the official data themselves, combined with information on how live births are defined. However, we find also that surveys are rather blunt instruments, and that the confidence intervals that surround estimates from these surveys are often large.},

The transition to small families increased downward intergenerational transfers (parents to children), and compensating upward transfers now take place outside the family. The growing independence of the elderly in the twentieth century is based on earlier investments in children.

We conducted a cohort study of Black and White women who delivered a singleton live-born or stillborn infant during 1981 through 2000. We analyzed stillbirth rates at 20 or more weeks of gestation within 7 age groups, 4 periods, and 10 ``central'' birth cohorts after adjusting for confounders., Results. In both racial groups, women younger than 20 years or 35 years or older were at increased risk of stillbirth; risks decreased over successive periods in all age groups. Birth cohort had no impact on stillbirth trends among Blacks and only a small, nonsignificant effect among Whites. Analyses of various APC combinations showed that Blacks were at a 1.2- to 2.9-fold increased risk for stillbirth relative to Whites. Attributable fractions for stillbirth because of age, period, and cohort effects were 16.5\%, 24.9\%, and 0.1\%, respectively, among Black women and 14.5\%, 36.2\%, and 2.1\%, respectively, among White women., Conclusions. Strong effects of age and period were observed in stillbirth trends, but these factors do not explain the persistent stillbirth disparity between Black and White women.},

These patterns appear across geography and time wherever reliable birth and death records are available (1, 2). The slight male bias, typically {$\sim$}51.3\% of live births, is so consistent (Fig. 1 A ) that when birth sex ratios deviate much from it, suspicions are aroused of sex-specific abortion or infanticide (3, 4). Putting together the birth sex ratio bias and the female survival advantage (5), we expect a monotonically declining sex ratio from birth to death, which is exactly what we find across cultures and across historical epochs (Fig. 1 B ). By age 100 y, there are three to four women for every surviving man, and by the extraordinary age of 110 y, 95\% of the survivors are women. Note, however, that until later life the sex ratio does not stray far from 50:50, an observation that would gladden the heart of evolutionary biologist, Sir Ronald Fisher, who argued that natural selection should favor equal parental expenditure\textemdash a delightfully vague phrase\textemdash in males and females (6). Fisher assumed, as have many since then, that the human sex ratio at conception is even more male-biased than the sex ratio at birth, and there were some good reasons to assume this.

  abstract = {Historically, women have lived longer than men in almost every country in the world. A similar pattern of sex differences in longevity is also found in many other species; however, it is not clear if there are more species in which females live longer or vice versa. For virtually all the primary causes of death and at virtually all ages, mortality rates are higher for men. Women do not live longer than men because they age more slowly, but because they are more robust at every age. Paradoxically, although women have lower mortality rates they have higher overall rates of physical illness than do men. Several hypotheses have been proposed for sex differences in longevity, including more active female immune functioning, the protective effect of estrogen, compensatory effects of the second X chromosome, reduction in the activity of growth hormone and the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling cascade, and the influence of oxidative stress on aging and disease. At present, none of these hypotheses are strongly supported, although weak support is available for the oxidative stress hypothesis. With the advent of more rapid genome sequencing, molecular tools will become available for more species, thus further detailing the causes for the differences in longevity between the sexes.},

  abstract = {The study of how parents divide investment between sons and daughters has become one of the most popular areas of discussion in evolutionary biology. Trivers \& Willard (1973, Science, 179, 90\textendash 92) suggested that the physical condition of the mother may influence whether she maximizes her lifetime reproductive success by biasing her investment towards sons or towards daughters. In this review I discuss the evidence for sex-biased maternal investment in primates. No consistent pattern emerges from data sets on sex differences in infant birth weights and growth rates, measures of nipple contact, and lengths of interbirth intervals with respect to maternal condition. Studies on birth sex ratios have also proven highly inconsistent. To test the Trivers \& Willard hypothesis, information on birth sex ratios, sex-biased mortality before and after birth, and patterns of maternal care during prenatal and postnatal life are required in a single population. Currently, no such information is available for any one population of primates, and will be difficult to obtain, owing to the long life span and complexity of social interactions of primates. An additional difficulty of testing the Trivers \& Willard hypothesis in primates is that it is hard to conceive of any empirical evidence that would disprove it as long as alternative adaptive explanations continue to be suggested for particular species and populations. A lack of correlation between maternal condition, birth sex ratio and maternal care could be interpreted as suggesting that additional factors have been overlooked. Direct predictions from the theory are required.},

We contend, based on extensive literature concerned with selection in utero, that this assumption remains questionable. At least a third and likely many more of human conceptions fail to yield a live birth. Those that survive to birth, moreover, do not represent their conception cohort. Increasing data availability has led to an improved understanding of selection in utero and its implications for population health. The literature describing selection in utero, however, receives relatively little attention from social scientists. We aim to draw attention to the rich theoretical and empirical literature on selection in utero by offering a typology that organizes this diverse work along dimensions we think important, if not familiar, to those studying population health. We further use the typology to identify important gaps in the literature. This work should interest social scientists for two reasons. First, phenomena of broad scholarly interest (i.e., social connectivity, bereavement) affect the extent and timing of selection in utero. Second, the life-course health of a cohort depends in part on the strength of such selection. We conclude by identifying new research directions and with a reconciliation of the apparent contradiction between the ``fetal origins'' literature and that describing selection in utero.},

Bryan provides a sweeping reinterpretation of the post\textendash Civil War South by framing the New South as a struggle over environmental stewardship. For more than six decades, scholars have caricatured southerners as so desperate for economic growth that they rapaciously consumed the region's abundant natural resources. Yet business leaders and public officials did not see profit and environmental quality as mutually exclusive goals, and they promoted methods of conserving resources that they thought would ensure long-term economic growth. Southerners called this idea ``permanence.'' But permanence was a contested concept, and these businesspeople clashed with other stakeholders as they struggled to find new ways of using valuable resources. The Price of Permanence shows how these struggles indelibly shaped the modern South.Bryan writes the region into the national conservation movement for the first time and shows that business leaders played a key role shaping the ideals of American conservationists. This book also dismantles one of the most persistent caricatures of southerners: that they had little interest in environmental quality. Conservation provided white elites with a tool for social control, and this is the first work to show how struggles over resource policy fueled Jim Crow. The ideology of ``permanence'' protected some resources but did not prevent degradation of the environment overall, and The Price of Permanence ultimately uses lessons from the New South to reflect on sustainability today.},

We know, for example, that fetal death increases more among males than females when the economy unexpectedly contracts; that unexpected economic contraction predicts low secondary sex ratios; and that males from low sex ratio birth cohorts live, on average, longer than those from high sex ratio cohorts. We also know that low levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (i.e., hCG) measured in the serum of pregnant women predict fetal death. We do not, however, know whether male survivors of conception cohorts subjected to contracting economies exhibit, as theory predicts, higher hCG than those from other cohorts. We show, in 71 monthly conception cohorts including nearly two million California births, that they do. We thereby add to the literature suggesting that the economy, a phenomenon over which we collectively exercise at least some control, affects population health. Our findings imply that the effect arises via natural selection \textendash{} a mechanism we largely ignore when attempting to explain, or alter, how collective choice affects our biology.},

We use monthly birth cohorts to determine if Japanese male births following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 fell below levels expected from female births and from history (i.e., autocorrelation) among cohorts exposed to the Earthquake at or after conception. Methods We apply interrupted time-series methods to 69 months (i.e., April, 2006 through December, 2011) of birth data from the most and least affected prefectures as well as from the remainder of Japan. We estimate expected male births from female births and from autocorrelation. Results Findings varied by distance from the greatest damage but suggest sensitive periods both early and late in gestation when population stressors may induce selection against males in utero. Support for reduced conception of males appeared only in the prefectures most damaged by the Earthquake. Conclusions Results align with the claim that natural selection has conserved mechanisms that reduce the odds of a male live birth during stressful times by reducing the conception of males and by increasing the rate of spontaneous abortion among male fetuses.

One explanation asserts that ambient stressors reduce the ratio of males to females conceived. The other argues that the maternal stress response selects against males in utero.

  abstract = {The `DOHaD' literature argues that stressors encountered at age t `program' individual health at age t+n, and that this programming appears strongest when t defines critical developmental periods including gestation. Accordingly, children of ill-nourished pregnant women suffer greater later life morbidity than do offspring of well-nourished mothers. The possibility that circumstances other than access to nutritious food drive both a mother's diet and fetal development remains, however, a threat to the inference of programming in utero. Attempts to rule out this threat include tests of the hypothesis that birth cohorts in gestation during famines exhibit shorter life spans than other cohorts. The tests produce conflicting results attributed to confounding by autocorrelation, selective migration and introduction of modern medicine. We offer a test in which neither medicine nor migration nor autocorrelation could obscure the presumed effect. We apply time-series regression methods to the life span of Swedes born between 1751 and 1800 to test the hypothesis that cohorts exposed in utero to the Swedish Famine of 1773 lived shorter lives than expected from trends and other forms of autocorrelation. We use these 50 birth cohorts not only because they included those exposed to severe famine but also because they may well be the only human birth cohorts that completed life unaffected by selective migration and unaided by modern medicine and for which we know life span. We find that the cohort born in 1773 live 4.2 years longer than expected from trends over the last half of the 18th century.},

From the testimony of those who lived it, Coffman traces the evolution of the American Army from "the days of small things"\textendash of limited resources and downright hardship\textendash to the modern military age that began at the turn of the century.},

In the tenth anniversary edition of this award-winning work, Patricia Hill Collins expands the basic arguments of the first edition by adding several important new themes. A new discussion of heterosexism as a system of power, an expanded treatment of images of Black womanhood, U.S. Black feminism's connections to Black Diasporic feminisms, and more attention to the importance of social class and nationalism all appear in the new edition. In addition, the new edition includes recent developments in black cultural studies, especially black popular culture, as well as recent events and trends such as the Anita Hill hearings and the backlash against affirmative action.},

However, the timing and causes of the decline are still poorly understood. While some scholars attribute it to general improvements in living standards, others emphasize the role of social intervention and public health reforms. Written by specialists from several disciplinary fields, the twelve essays in this book break entirely new ground by providing a long-term perspective that challenges some deep-rooted ideas about the European experience of mortality decline and may help explain the forces and causal relationships behind the still tragic incidence of preventable infant and child deaths in many parts of the world today. This book will become a standard work for students and researchers in demography, social and economic history, population geography, and the history of medicine, and it will be of interest to anyone concerned with current debates on the policies to be adopted to curb infant and child mortality in both developed and developing countries.},

  abstract = {In composition studies, the most influential statement of what Brian Street calls the autonomous model of literacy is the work of Walter Ong. Ong bases the foundation of this model on the research on cognitive development done by Alexander Luria, a student of Lev Vygotsky. Ong finds in this research, carried out among the Islamic people of Uzbekistan in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, empirical evidence for his contention that literacy actually causes fundamental changes in human cognition. The weakness of this interpretation is that it fails to consider the context. Ong's reading ignores not only the ethnocentrism and the propaganda value of Luria's research but also the political ideology incorporated into the experiment. In addition, Ong's autonomous reading allows him to dismiss as "elaborate Marxist scaffolding" the theory underlying Luria's project. This theory of the relationship of language, society, and individual thought leads to a richer explanation of the Uzbeki data than either Ong's neutral autonomous reading or Luria's rudimentary Marxist interpretation. This alternative explanation has implications for our own literacy instruction, for it is consistent with David Bartholomae's findings about the written language of freshmen attempting to move into the academic discourse community.

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the role of social relationships in explaining patterns of health. We contribute to this debate by investigating the impact of social capital on self-reported health for eight countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States. We rely on three indicators of social capital at the individual level (trust, participation in local organisations, social isolation) and employ alternative procedures to estimate consistently the impact of social capital on health. The three social capital indicators are choice variables and are hence, by definition, endogenously determined. We attempt to circumvent the endogeneity problems by using instrumental variable estimates. Our results show that the individual degree of trust is positively and significantly correlated with health, this being true with least squares estimators as well as when relying on instrumental variable estimators with (and without) community fixed effects. Similarly, social isolation is negatively and significantly associated with health, irrespective of the procedure of estimation. On the other hand, the effect of being a member of a Putnamesque organisation is more ambiguous and usually not significantly related to health.

In this essay, we analyze one of the online forums that helped propel Trump to electoral victory. Drawing on social movement concepts and an analysis of 1,762 posts, we show how leaders of the forum the ``Red Pill'' were able to move a community of adherents from understanding men's rights as a personal philosophy to political action. This transition was no small endeavor. The Red Pill forum was explicitly apolitical until the summer before the 2016 election. During the election, forum leaders linked the forum's neoliberal, misogynistic collective identity of alpha masculinity to Trump's public persona and framed his political ascendance as an opportunity to effectively push back against feminism and get a ``real'' man into the White House. We argue that while previous research shows the importance of alt-right virtual spaces in creating and maintaining racist collective identities, we know very little about how men conceptualize gender in ways that inform their personal and political action\textemdash and this is to our detriment. We conclude the essay by arguing that feminists need to understand how men cultivate extreme personal and political identities in online forums so that we can better understand how new technologies are used to move individuals from the armchair to the streets.},

  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},
  abstract = {By the mid-eighteenth century, the transatlantic slave trade was considered to be a necessary and stabilizing factor in the capitalist economies of Europe and the expanding Americas. Britain was the most influential power in this system which seemed to have the potential for unbounded growth. In 1833, the British empire became the first to liberate its slaves and then to become a driving force toward global emancipation. There has been endless debate over the reasons behind this decision. This has been portrayed on the one hand as a rational disinvestment in a foundering overseas system, and on the other as the most expensive per capita expenditure for colonial reform in modern history. In this work, Seymour Drescher argues that the plan to end British slavery, rather than being a timely escape from a failing system, was, on the contrary, the crucial element in the greatest humanitarian achievement of all time. The Mighty Experiment explores how politicians, colonial bureaucrats, pamphleteers, and scholars taking anti-slavery positions validated their claims through rational scientific arguments going beyond moral and polemical rhetoric, and how the infiltration of the social sciences into this political debate was designed to minimize agitation on both sides and provide common ground. Those at the inception of the social sciences, such as Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, helped to develop these tools to create an argument that touched on issues of demography, racism, and political economy. By the time British emancipation became legislation, it was being treated as a massive social experiment, whose designs, many thought, had the potential to change the world. This study outlines the relationship of economic growth to moral issues in regard to slavery, and will appeal to scholars of British history, nineteenth century imperial history, the history of slavery, and those interested in the history of human rights. The Mighty Experiment was the winner of First Prize, Frederick Douglass Book Prize, Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition.},

Analyzing data from demographic surveys carried out around 2005, we confirm the persistence of high sex ratios in these three countries and document significant differences in fertility intentions and behavior according to the sex of the previous child or children that constitute evidence of the practice of sex-selective abortion. These countries combine societal features and medical systems that make this phenomenon possible: son preference in a context of low fertility and the possibility of prenatal sex selection given easy access to ultrasound screening and induced abortion. Why high sex ratios are observed only in these three countries of the sub-region remains, however, an open question.},

Although a number of new accounts cast colonial empires in a more favorable light than has generally been customary, others contend that colonial powers often leveraged their imbalance in power to impose institutional arrangements on the colonies that were adverse to long-term development. We argue here, however, that one of the most fundamental impacts of European colonization may have been in altering the composition of the populations in the areas colonized. The efforts of the Europeans often involved implanting ongoing communities who were greatly advantaged over natives in terms of human capital and legal status. Because the paths of institutional development were sensitive to the incidence of extreme inequality which resulted, their activity had long lingering effects. More study is needed to identify all of the mechanisms at work, but the evidence from the colonies in the Americas suggests that it was those that began with extreme inequality and population heterogeneity that came to exhibit persistence over time in evolving institutions that restricted access to economic opportunities and generated lower rates of public investment in schools and other infrastructure considered conducive to growth. These patterns may help to explain why a great many societies with legacies as colonies with extreme inequality have suffered from poor development experiences.},

By 1700 its population was about three-fifths black, almost all enslaved, and the population of Amerindians had almost disappeared on the islands and was quite small on the Guyanese coastal areas of South America and in British Honduras in Central America. In the two centuries examined, six European nations were involved in the colonization process. Three of these represented relatively minor colonies \textemdash{} the Dutch, the Danish and, the smallest, the Swedish (who owned St Bartholomew between 1784 and 1877), and three were of considerable importance, although their relative shares did vary over time - the English, the Spanish and the French. The patterns of settlement of the Spanish colonies (where the shares of non-whites tended to be below onehalf) differed from those of the other European nations. Among the other European settlers, after 1700, the populations were generally about 70 to 90 per cent black, most enslaved until the ending of slavery - by revolution in Haiti and by metropolitan legislation in the other areas. For the Spanish settlements, however, there were smaller percentages of blacks, while the proportion of non-whites included more free persons of colour than did the other areas.},

Virginia's Prince Edward County stands as perhaps the most extreme. Rather than fund integrated schools, the county's board of supervisors closed public schools from 1959 until 1964. The only formal education available for those locked out of school came in 1963 when the combined efforts of Prince Edward's African American community and aides from President John F. Kennedy's administration established the Prince Edward County Free School Association (Free School). This temporary school system would serve just over 1,500 students, both black and white, aged 6 through 23.Drawing upon extensive archival research, Resisting Brown presents the Free School as a site in which important rhetorical work took place. Candace Epps-Robertson analyzes public discourse that supported the school closures as an effort and manifestation of citizenship and demonstrates how the establishment of the Free School can be seen as a rhetorical response to white supremacist ideologies. The school's mission statements, philosophies, and commitment to literacy served as arguments against racialized constructions of citizenship. Prince Edward County stands as a microcosm of America's struggle with race, literacy, and citizenship.},

Unfortunately, U.S. infant mortality rates prior to 1950 suffer from an upward bias stemming from a severe underregistration of births. At one extreme, African American births in southern states went unregistered at the rate of 15\% to 25\%. In this study, we construct improved estimates of births and infant mortality in the United States for 1915-1940 using recently released complete count decennial census microdata combined with the counts of infant deaths from published sources. We check the veracity of our estimates with a major birth registration study completed in conjunction with the 1940 decennial census and find that the largest adjustments occur in states with less-complete birth registration systems. An additional advantage of our census-based estimation method is the extension backward of the birth and infant mortality series for years prior to published estimates of registered births, enabling previously impossible comparisons and estimations. Finally, we show that underregistration can bias effect estimates even in a panel setting with specifications that include location fixed effects and place-specific linear time trends.},

  abstract = {Between 1850 and 1925, the crude death rate in the City of Chicago fell by 60 percent. We estimate that 30-50 percent of this reduction can be attributed water purification measures and the subsequent eradication of diarrheal diseases and typhoid fever and its sequella. Our findings are consistent with a proposition that early public-health scholars referred to as the Mills-Reincke phenomenon. According to advocates of the Mills-Reincke phenomenon, for every one death from typhoid fever that was prevented by water purification, there were three or more deaths from other causes (not usually considered waterborne) that were also prevented. At least part of this phenomenon appears to have driven by the fact that typhoid had a low case fatality rate but so weakened its survivors that they were vulnerable to later infections from tuberculosis and pneumonia. There is also evidence that typhoid survivors eventually developed kidney problems from which they later succumbed. These findings have implications for public health policies in developing countries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDMost Romani groups in Europe have experienced a decline in childhood mortality during recent decades. These crucial transformations are rarely addressed in research or public policy. OBJECTIVEThis paper analyzes the timing and structure of the decline of childhood mortality among the Gitano people of Spain. METHODSThe paper is based on the family and genealogy reconstitution of the Gitano population of 22 contiguous localities in Southern Spain. Registry data from over 19,100 people and 3,501 reconstituted families was included in a dense genealogical grid ranging over 150 years. From this database we produced annual time series of infant and child mortality and of the registered causes of death from 1871 to 2005. RESULTSThe analyzed data shows a rapid decline in infant and child mortality from about 1949 to 1970. The onset of the definitive decline occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Child mortality was higher in the pre-transitional period and started to decline earlier, although it took longer to converge with majority rates. The mortality transition in the Gitano minority paralleled that of the dominant majority, but with important delays and higher mortality rates. The causes of death show the deprivation suffered by Gitano people. CONCLUSIONSThe childhood mortality decline facilitated the most important changes experienced recently by the Gitano minority, including its fertility transition and the transformation of Gitanos' gender and family systems. CONTRIBUTIONThis is one of the first historical reconstructions of the mortality transition of a Romani population.},

  abstract = {This study analysed sex ratios at birth (defined as the number of male births per 100 female births) using data on children ever-born from three censuses conducted in Ethiopia in 1984, 1994 and 2007. The results showed very high values by any standard, with an average of 108.4 for a sample of some 8.2 million births, with somewhat lower values in urban areas. Analysis of socioeconomic correlates revealed that the sex ratio varied very much by household wealth, from about 110 for very poor women to about 102 for wealthier women. The high value of the sex ratio at birth in Ethiopia could be explained by poverty, used as a proxy for poor nutritional status. In multivariate analysis, the effects of living in urban areas and of maternal education were less important than household wealth. Among the many ethno-linguistic groups, the Nilotic family had higher sex ratios than other groups. The results were confirmed using data from DHS surveys conducted in the country, and by the analysis of children still living at time of census.},

  abstract = {SEXIST DISEASES MICHEL GARENNE* and MONIQUE LAEONf Introduction In human populations, females usually have a lower mortality than males at any age. This pattern is observed for most causes of death due to chronic diseases, accidents, and violence [1-4]. However, lower female mortality is not universal, and a reverse pattern of excess female mortality has been observed for some infectious diseases. Whooping cough is often quoted in the medical literature as being more lethal for girls than for boys [5] . Another such recently documented disease is measles [6]. Both are airborne diseases for which the incidence is virtually identical for males and females. This implies that differences in mortality demonstrate a difference in case fatality. The excess female mortality from measles and whooping cough is found throughout the world, in places as different as Europe,Japan, North America, Africa, and Latin America. This implies a biological difference rather than a cultural pattern, and therefore a higher susceptibility for females . In casual reports made throughout the world, and especial!)' among older children and young adults, excess female mortality has been observed in certain other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, typhoid and paratyphoid , typhus, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, influenza, and congenital syphilis [7-9]. The two striking features of these early studies are the highly selective list of diseases exhibiting excess female mortality and the changing pattern by age. Late childhood and early adulthood appear to be the life periods when females are the most vulnerable compared to males. The explanation for a higher vulnerability of females for certain infectious diseases could be sought in differences between the male and female The authors would like to thank Prof. Samuel Preston (University of Pennsylvania) and Dr. Brian Ward (McGiIl University) for comments on the demographic and immunologic aspects of the manuscript; Dr. Desmond Martin (National Institute for Virology, South Africa) for personal communications on various diseases; and Ms. Shelah Bhalti (Harvard University) for editorial comments. * Centre Francais sur la Population et le D\'eveloppement (CEPED), 15 rue de l'Ecole de M\'edecine, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France. f Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Docteur Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.\textcopyright{} 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Recently, lymphocytes have been divided into two subsets, Th-I and Th-2, according to the cytokines they produce [10, H]. Th-I are major producers of IL-2, and IFN-?, whereas Th-2 produce high levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-IO. Stimulation of Th-2 lymphocytes activates antibody secretion, whereas stimulation of Th-I lymphocytes facilitates cytotoxic T cells. The balance between Th-I and Th-2 responses seems to be essential for resistance to disease and survival. Recently, evidence accumulated showing that male and female immune systems do not mount immune responses in the same way [12]. Females seem to favor a Th-2 response , whereas males favor a Th-I response. This is especially true during pregnancy, when there is a drop of Th-I cytokines and an increase of Th-2 cytokines [13, 14]. The fact that sex hormones can regulate the Th-I/ Th-2 balance [15, 16] could explain the differences between male and female mortality for certain infectious diseases, especially among young adults when the level of sex hormones is the highest. The goals of this study were (1) to systematically search for groups of infectious diseases showing different male and female mortality during late childhood and early adulthood, (2) to investigate the characteristics of the Th-I and Th-2 responses to certain infectious diseases, and (3) to test the plausibility of the sex hormones explanation. This hypothesis linking the hormonal and the immunological systems and the way the body copes with infectious diseases could explain both the direction and the changing pattern of gender differences in mortality by age. Demographic Evidence The demographic data originated from the World Health Statistics, a databank computerized by the World Health Organization from national causes of death statistics. Data originated from 110 countries throughout the world between 1950 and 1989. These were mostly developed...},

Despite arguments about its relevance, uniform measurement of infant mortality is necessary to guarantee its use as a valid measure of population health. Using important socioeconomic indicators, we develop a novel method to adjust country-specific reported infant mortality figures that may misrepresent development within a country. We conclude that an ``augmented'' measure of mortality that includes both infant and late fetal deaths should be considered when assessing levels of social welfare in a country. Also, mortality statistics that exhibit a substantially high ratio of late fetal to early neonatal deaths should be more closely scrutinized.},

The hypothesis that during and shortly after periods of war the human secondary sex ratio is higher has received little statistical treatment. In this paper we evaluate the war hypothesis using 3 statistical methods: linear regression, randomization, and time-series analysis. Live birth data from 10 different countries were included. Although we cannot speak of a general phenomenon, statistical evidence for an association between warfare and live birth sex ratio was found for several countries. Regression and randomization test results were in agreement. Time-series analysis showed that most human sex-ratio time series can be described by a common model. The results obtained using intervention models differed somewhat from results obtained by regression methods.},

Graff continues his critical revisions of many commonly held ideas about literacy. The book speaks to central concerns about the place of literacy in modern and late-modern culture and society, and its complicated historical foundations.Drawing on other aspects of his research, Graff places the chapters that follow in the context of current thinking and major concerns about literacy, and the development of both historical and interdisciplinary studies. Special emphasis falls upon the usefulness of "the literacy myth" as an important subject for interdisciplinary study and understanding. Critical stock-taking of the field includes reflections on Graff's own research and writings of the last three decades, and the relationships that connect interdisciplinary rethinking and the literacy myth.The collection is noteworthy for its attention to Graff's reflections on his identification of "the literacy myth" and in developing LiteracyStudies@OSU (Ohio State University) as a model for university-wide interdisciplinary programs. It also deals with ordinary concerns about literacy, or illiteracy, that are shared by academics and concerned citizens. These nontechnical essays will speak to both academic and nonacademic audiences across disciplines and cultural orientations.},

  abstract = {Adult mortality has been lower in Kyrgyzstan vs. Russia among males since at least 1981 and among females since 1999. Also, Kyrgyzstan's mortality fluctuations have had smaller amplitude. This has occurred in spite of worse macro-economic outcomes in Kyrgyzstan. To understand these surprising patterns, we analyzed cause-specific mortality in Kyrgyzstan vs. Russia for the period 1981-2010, using unpublished official data. We find that, as in Russia, fluctuations in Kyrgyzstan have been primarily due to changes in external causes and circulatory causes, and alcohol appears to play an important role. However, in contrast with Russia, mortality from these causes in Kyrgyzstan has been lower and has increased by a smaller amount. As a result, the mortality gap between the two countries is overwhelmingly attributable to external and cardio-vascular causes, and more generally, to causes that have been shown to be strongly related to alcohol consumption. These cause-specific results, together with the existence of large ethnic differentials in mortality in Kyrgyzstan, highlight the importance of cultural and religious differences, and their impact on patterns of alcohol consumption, in explaining the mortality gap between the two countries. These findings show that explanatory frameworks relying solely on macro-economic factors are not sufficient for understanding differences in mortality levels and trends among former Soviet republics.},

As a result, the impact of the break-up of the Soviet Union on infant mortality in the region is not known, and proper monitoring of mortality levels is impaired. In this paper, we use a variety of data sources and methods to assess infant mortality levels and trends in one Central Asian republic, Kyrgyzstan, between 1980 and 2010. We find that, contrary to what the registration data indicate, infant mortality abruptly stopped declining during the decade following the break-up of the Soviet Union. We also find that infants of Central Asian ethnicity or born in rural areas remain considerably more at risk, in contrast with what the reported levels show. We discuss the implication of these findings for health policy and for understanding the nature of the health crisis in this understudied part of the former Soviet Union.},

This article relies on back-projection methods, new estimates of nineteenth-century mortality, and the 1850-1940 Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) samples to estimate age- and sex-specific net census underenumeration of the native-born white population in the United States in the 1850-1930 censuses. National and section of birth estimates are constructed. In general, the results suggest slightly higher net undercounts for native-born white males relative to native-born white females, slightly higher net undercounts in the South, and a modest trend toward greater census coverage over time. A few censuses stand out as anomalous. The 1870 census suffered a higher net rate of omission than any other census. The net undercount was especially high in the South, probably reflecting the unsettled conditions in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The net undercount was not nearly as great as nineteenth-century observers speculated and subsequent historians have long believed, however. The 1880 census appears to have achieved the most complete coverage of the native-born white population before 1940.},

  abstract = {Introduction Irish Travellers are a nomadic minority group on the island of Ireland (IOI). The All Ireland Traveller Health Study (2010) showed inequalities in socioeconomic and health indicators. The infant mortality rate (IMR) in 1987 was 18.1 (95\% CI 10.9 to 25.3) per 1000 births, one of the highest in Europe. The aim of this study was to calculate the IMR, neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and postneonatal mortality rate (PNMR) for Ireland Travellers, to compare with the general Irish population, and to describe major causes of death. Methodology The Traveller birth cohort study comprises all Traveller babies born between 14 October 2008 and 13 October 2009 (n=986) on IOI and followed up over 1 year. Cohort ascertainment strategies to estimate infant mortality included data collected through public health nurses (PHNs), Traveller health projects (THPs), mass media such as parish newsletter and Traveller-specific social magazines. A comprehensive search for death certificates was performed in the General Register Office with confirmation of Traveller status sought from PHNs/THPs. Results 12 infant deaths were identified in IOI based on cohort period, including 1 death from Northern Ireland. Some deaths were not officially registered. Using capture-recapture technique, an estimated true range of infant deaths was calculated as 10 to 15 cases. Congenital anomalies (n=5), preterm births (n=2), metabolic diseases (n=4) and accidents (n=1) are the leading causes of death. The cohort IMR for ROI Travellers was 12.0 (95\% CI 5.5 to 19.7), 3.7 times the general population IMR 3.2 (92\% CI 3.22 to 3.24) and 2.7 times the European average in 2008. The ROI Traveller NMR was 5.4 (95\% CI 5.3 to 5.6), almost twice the 2008 European average, compared to 2.27 (95\% CI 2.26 to 2.29) for the general Irish population and 14.4 (95\% CI 14.1 to 14.7) for Travellers in 1987. PNMR increased by 180\% from 3.6 (95\% CI 3.4 to 3.8) in 1987 to 6.5 (95\% CI 6.4 to 6.7) in 2009; for general Irish population in 2009, the PNMR was 0.95 (95\% CI 0.95 to 0.96). Conclusion There has been some improvement in Traveller infant mortality over two decades, however the greater improvement in the general population results in a widening gap. Improvement in neonatal care has shifted previous neonatal deaths to the postneonatal period. The raised infant mortality is not associated with factors related to adverse social conditions, a positive finding.},

  abstract = {Since Pre-Columbian times, humans have exploited Jamaican marine ecosystems with significant consequences for flora and fauna. This study focuses on the history of reef fish exploitation in Jamaica, from first human occupation to the present day, to determine how past fishing activities contributed to subsequent declines in the coral reef ecosystem. The pattern of declining reef fish populations was nonlinear. Reef fish first declined in prehistoric times but then potentially recovered, following genocide of the native human population. Reduced fishing pressure lasted until the mid-19th century. At that time, depletion of reef fish populations again occurred with a precipitous decline from the 1850s to the 1940s. The final shift from relatively abundant to overfished marine fauna corresponded to subtle changes in fish trap design as well as development of recreational fishing. Government subsidies throughout the second half of the 20th century exacerbated the declines. This analysis shows that local artisanal fisheries with relatively low levels of effort and seemingly subtle shifts in technology can significantly impact the coral reef ecosystem and that declines occurred decades to centuries before modern ecological studies began. This research shows how historical analysis can be a powerful tool to minimize shifted baselines and establish realistic targets for recovery and sustainable management of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {One of the prevailing myths about the American family is that there once existed a harmonious family with three generations living together, and that this "ideal" family broke down under the impact of urbanization and industrialization. The essays in Families, History, and Social Change challenge this myth and provide dramatic revisions of simplistic notions about change in the American family. In these interdisciplinary essays that are deeply rooted in history, Hareven provides important perspectives on family relations in the present, dispels myths about family relations in the past, offers new directions in research and interpretation, and revises our understanding of social change. Hareven's essays, which are based on thirty years of research, combine empirical evidence with theoretical frameworks and discussions of the state of the art in this exciting field. The essays cover a wide spectrum of issues and topics such as the organization of the family and the household, the networks available to children as they were growing up, the role of the family in the process of industrialization, the division of labor in the family along gender lines, and the relations between the generations in the later years of life. Coincidentally, the essays revolve around three central themes: The family's interaction with the process of industrialization, the life course, and the development of the field of family history\textendash and its future directions. They are both interdisciplinary and cross-cultural.Professor Hareven is a pioneer and leader in the development of the field of family history. Her work makes a major contribution to the theoretical and substantive aspects of scholarship on family life, past and present, and on social change. Her essays also provide a fine understanding of this field's development.},

To lose your mother is to be severed from your kin, to forget your past, and to inhabit the world as an outsider.

Human sex ratio at birth at the population level has been suggested to vary according to exogenous stressors such as wars, ambient temperature, ecological disasters and economic crises, but their relative effects on birth sex ratio have not been investigated. It also remains unclear whether such associations represent environmental forcing or adaptive parental response, as parents may produce the sex that has better survival prospects and fitness in a given environmental challenge. 2. We examined the simultaneous role of wars, famine, ambient temperature, economic development and total mortality rate on the annual variation of offspring birth sex ratio and whether this variation, in turn, was related to sex-specific infant mortality rate in Finland during 1865\textendash 2003. 3. Our findings show an increased excess of male births during the World War II and during warm years. Instead, economic development, famine, short-lasting Finnish civil war and total mortality rate were not related to birth sex ratio. Moreover, we found no association between annual birth sex ratio and sex-biased infant mortality rate among the concurrent cohort. 4. Our results propose that some exogenous challenges like ambient temperature and war can skew human birth sex ratio and that these deviations likely represent environmental forcing rather than adaptive parental response to such challenges.},

This work has resulted in the creation of a body of doctrine on such matters as the causes of rural economic inequality and abysmal poverty which has hardened the arteries of our thought. The doctrine is far too generalised to have any practical utility; it is ahistorical; and it usually involves the dangerous and false belief that all cultivators in any particular community are apt to have similar economic responses. So firm is this orthodoxy (which has a wide political spectrum), so great the fear of the chaos which would result from emphasising the significance of the heterogeneity of socio-economic structures, that under-development studies have become deadlocked - to the point that our ignorance is constantly on the increase. The book represents a radical assault on prevailing orthodoxy: it is an attempt to break the deadlock by insisting on the prior need for the proper categorisation of the main types of agrarian system in the tropical world, which are not necessarily at all numerous. It is, moreover, a thoroughly practical demonstration of the possibilities of identifying one of these important categories and of drawing useful generalised conclusions about it, on the basis of detailed fieldwork in parts of northern Nigeria and south India.},

  abstract = {{$<$}div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"{$><$}p{$>$}The Hausa institution of paternal gandu is a voluntary, mutually advantageous, agreement between father and married son, under which the son works in a subordinate capacity on his father's farms in return for a great variety of benefits including a share of the food supplies. Nowadays in Batagarawa the gandu group usually, though not invariably, dissolves within a year or two of the father's death, when each son appropriates a portion of the gandu farmland and sets up as an independent farmer.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Starting with a general historical introduction, this chapter deals mainly with paternal gandu in Batagarawa. It lists the numerous rights and obligations which reciprocally link fathers and sons and considers the extent to which actual practices deviate from stated norms. It is concerned with the incidence of gandu and the circumstances in which sons leave gandu. It presents material relating to the `private farming' of sons-in-gandu. It examines the fragility of fraternal gandu. But consideration of many wider related issues is postponed until later chapters.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The word `gandu'{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The word `gandu' has many different meanings. It may denote a farm (or farms), a group of men, the relationship between the men concerned, a condition of trust, a large farm, a farm owned by a chief in virtue of his office, tribute (or tax), or a store of money (gandun kudi). The word in its present-day usage among Muslim Hausa should never be identified, in the manner of several writers, with the `extended family', nor with `ancestral land'.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

  abstract = {This book, which reports on fieldwork done in an exceedingly densely populated locality of rural Hausaland (Dorayi) in 1971-1972, is complete in itself. In it Dr Hill compares and contrasts Dorayi with the much less densely populated village of her previous study, with special reference to the consequences of high and persistent population density; she also attempts to interpret the present-day stability of this stagnating, impoverished, overcrowded community in terms of socio-economic conditions in rural Kano Emirate generally in very early colonial times, utilising archival as well as field material. Some of the consequences of persistent population pressure are most surprising (an example is the brake it puts on outward migration): they will be eagerly studied by demographers who commonly search in vain for relevant socio-economic studies, particularly any dealing with the plight of the most impoverished, who tend to get overlooked.},

  abstract = {This book was originally published in 1972 and relates to the Hausa-speaking people of West Africa. At the time of publication there were perhaps as many as 15 million Hausa-speaking people in the area, most of whom lived in the countryside in northern Nigeria and the neighbouring Niger Republic. This book is at once an examination of the socio-economic life of a small Hausa village and a study of the way of life of the rural Hausa generally. The book as a whole provides a wide-ranging survey both of what was known and of what was, and in some cases still is, little understood. Very few books had been written on the rural Hausa, much of the literature consisting of scarce pamphlets and official reports; this book not only reports important research, but also surveys literature which was otherwise not generally available. The themes which emerge from this study are similar to many which Polly Hill has stressed elsewhere: people who do not fit into crude stereotypes and socio-economic life are always much more varied and sophisticated than superficial observers would suppose.},

However, policy intervention in the form of the Old Poor Law blocked the transmission of poverty and avoided permanent pauperism.

Methods Data on live births and fetal deaths in the U.S. for the period 1979\textendash 1990 were examined by birth weight group and race using Kitagawa's method for analysis of the crude fetal death rate. Results In the period 1979-1990, all racial groups had a decrease in the crude fetal death rate, more so in whites and others (about 22\%) than in blacks (10\%). In the white population, 73.4\% of the total reduction in the crude fetal death rate was attributable to the improvement in birth weight-specific fetal death rates, and the remaining portion of the reduction was due to a favorable change in birth weight distribution. In the black population, the reduction in the crude fetal death rate was entirely attributable to the improvement in the birth weight-specific fetal death rates. However, in other groups, a favorable change in the birth weight distribution was the major determinant. Although black births represented 16.5\% of all births in the U.S., they accounted for 26\textendash 29\% of the crude fetal death rate. Disparity in the crude fetal death rates for blacks and whites is explained almost entirely by differences in birth weight distribution. Conclusion A further decrease in the crude fetal death rate in the U.S. requires a decrease in low birth weights, particularly in blacks.},

While the total population at contact is still unknown, political and cultural biases have generally forced estimates into artificially high or low ranges. There is general agreement that the shock of contact with invading Europeans led to substantial reductions among most aboriginal populations, but in North America some groups were much less disrupted than others. Many original populations disappeared altogether, but whether or not their demise was primarily a function of short-run, rapid disruption caused by disease and/or warfare, or a slower process spread out over several generations involving assimilation in its various forms, remains uncertain. With the establishment of the reservation system in the 19th century a basis was provided for continued demographic and cultural survival. By the early 20th century most reservation populations were beginning a demographic transition based on declining death rates and high fertility. For several generations rapid growth has continued. As urbanization increases recent fertility declines are expected to accelerate even further. Meanwhile the rapid urbanization of the surviving native peoples poses a real threat to their cultural distinctiveness. Finally, all phases of native American demographic history are characterized by defective and inadequate data which makes straightforward description or analysis perilous.},

This article argues that their numerical decline was related to their determination to maintain high and undiminished standards of living for themselves and their heirs. Since the proper endowment of more than a small number of elite children threatened the material basis of family status, reproductively active married couples tried to restrict effective replacement (on average) to two married children. Since a large fraction of elite couples (15 to 30 percent) were childless, aggregate demographic decline (in a closed population) was inevitable. Currently, the world's wealthiest countries are also faced with impending demographic contraction. Parallels are drawn between the status-protecting strategies of traditional elites and those of ordinary couples in modern developed populations, whose high-cost, high-risk children have more in common with those raised by elite families than with children in traditional agrarian economies whose labor and insurance value secured, rather than threatened, their parents' status.},

Due to the synergism between undernutrition and many infectious diseases, the food proscriptions may contribute to greater morbidity and mortality among young children in populations which adhere to them. Therefore writers describing these traditional child feeding practices have often recommended intervention by health workers, particularly nutrition education programs emphasizing the dangers to child health.},

How important was patriarchy and a husband's control over his wife? And what were the options available to Irish men and women who wished to leave an unhappy marriage? This first comprehensive history of marriage in Ireland across three centuries looks below the level of elite society for a multi-faceted exploration of how marriage was perceived, negotiated and controlled by the church and state, as well as by individual men and women within Irish society. Making extensive use of new and under-utilised primary sources, Maria Luddy and Mary O'Dowd explain the laws and customs around marriage in Ireland. Revising current understandings of marital law and relations, Marriage in Ireland, 1660\textendash 1925 represents a major new contribution to Irish historical studies.},

  abstract = {The degree to which biological factors contribute to the existence and the widening of mortality differences by sex remains unclear. To address this question, a mortality analysis for the years 1890 to 1995 was performed comparing mortality data on more than 11,000 Catholic nuns and monks in Bavarian communities living in very nearly identical behavioral and environmental conditions with life table data for the general German population. While the mortality differences between women and men in the general German population increased considerably after World War II, they remained almost constant among the members of Bavarian religious orders during the entire observation period, with slight advantages for nuns. Thus, the higher differences observable in the general population cannot be attributed to biological factors. The different trends in sex-specific mortality between the general and the cloistered populations are caused exclusively by men in the general population who were unable to follow the trend in mortality reduction of women, nuns, and especially monks. Under the special environmental conditions of nuns and monks, biological factors appear to confer a maximum survival advantage for women of no more than one year in remaining life expectancy at young adult ages.},

Direct observation and census data suggested that gender ratios deviated sufficiently from what is known to be normal in modern human populations to suggest that the phenomenon was not random. Researchers have explored major proximate causes of ``missing'' girls and women such as female-selective abortion, routine neglect of young girls in their families including differential access to modern medical care, and even infanticide. This article uses Sen's work and the research of others on Asia to compare with evidence of the disadvantaging or even ``mortal neglect'' of girls and women in Western European society in the early modern and modern periods \textemdash{} roughly from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. It argues that the current state of the evidence suggests little support for similar gender-specific forms of mortal neglect in Western Europe. It explores why this may have been so, using evidence from economic, social, demographic and religious life. \ding{73} The author would like to thank Amy Patterson for research and editorial help; and George Alter, Fabian Drixler, Joel Harrington, Satomi Kurosu, Donald Sutton, Frans van Poppel and an anonymous reader for the journal for their insightful comments and suggestions for revisions of a previous draft of this article.

  abstract = {Members of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation community near Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, voiced concerns that there appeared to be fewer male children in their community in recent years. In response to these concerns, we assessed the sex ratio (proportion of male births) of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation over the period 1984\textendash 2003 as part of a community-based participatory research project. The trend in the proportion of male live births of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation has been declining continuously from the early 1990s to 2003, from an apparently stable sex ratio prior to this time. The proportion of male births (m) showed a statistically significant decline over the most recent 10-year period (1994\textendash 2003) (m = 0.412, p = 0.008) with the most pronounced decrease observed during the most recent 5 years (1999\textendash 2003) (m = 0.348, p = 0.006). Numerous factors have been associated with a decrease in the proportion of male births in a population, including a number of environmental and occupational chemical exposures. This community is located within the Great Lakes St. Clair River Area of Concern and is situated immediately adjacent to several large petrochemical, polymer, and chemical industrial plants. Although there are several potential factors that could be contributing to the observed decrease in sex ratio of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, the close proximity of this community to a large aggregation of industries and potential exposures to compounds that may influence sex ratios warrants further assessment into the types of chemical exposures for this population. A community health survey is currently under way to gather more information about the health of the Aamjiwnaang community and to provide additional information about the factors that could be contributing to the observed decrease in the proportion of male births in recent years.},

Births and birth rates increased among all race and Hispanic-origin groups. Teen childbearing rose 3\% in 2006, to 41.9 per 1000 females aged 15 to 19 years, the first increase after 14 years of steady decline. Birth rates rose 2\% to 4\% for women aged 20 to 44; rates for the youngest (10\textendash 14 years) and oldest (45\textendash 49) women were unchanged. Childbearing by unmarried women increased steeply in 2006 and set new historic highs. The cesarean-delivery rate rose by 3\% in 2006 to 31.1\% of all births; this figure has been up 50\% over the last decade. Preterm and low birth weight rates also increased for 2006 to 12.8\% and 8.3\%, respectively. The 2005 infant mortality rate was 6.89 infant deaths per 1000 live births, not statistically higher than the 2004 level. Non-Hispanic black newborns continued to be more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants to die in the first year of life in 2004. For all gender and race groups combined, expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.9 years in 2005. Age-adjusted death rates in the United States continue to decline. The crude death rate for children aged 1 to 19 years decreased significantly between 2000 and 2005. Of the 10 leading causes of death for children in 2005, only the death rate for cerebrovascular disease was up slightly from 2000, whereas accident and chronic lower respiratory disease death rates decreased. A large proportion of childhood deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The limited scientific knowledge on relationship between exposure and health effects in relation to geothermal activity motivated an epidemiologic investigation in Tuscan geothermal area. The study aims to describe the health status of populations living in Tuscany municipalities where concessions for exploitation of geothermal resources were granted. DESIGN: This is an ecological study, so it is not useful to produce evidence to sustain a judgment on the cause-effect link. The major limits of this type of study are the use of the residence at municipal level as a proxy of exposure to both environmental and socioeconomic factors and the use of aggregated data of health outcomes that can lead to the well-known ecological fallacy. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen municipalities were included in the study area: eight are part of the so-called "traditional" geothermal area, defined as Northern Geothermal Area (NGA) and eight located in the Amiata Mountain defined as Southern Geothermal Area (SGA). In 2000-2006, the average resident population in the overall area was approximately 43,000 inhabitants. Thirty-one geothermal power plants were active, with a production capacity of 811 MW, 5 of them with 88 MW located in the SGA. Statistical analyses on the entire geothermal area, NGA and SGA subareas, and the sixteen municipalities were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality data were obtained from Tuscany Regional Mortality Registry for the 1971-2006 period, analysing 60 causes of death, of interest for population health status or consistent with "Project SENTIERI" criteria. Hospital discharge records of residents in Tuscany Region in 2004-2006, anywhere admitted to hospital, were analyzed considering only the main diagnosis, excluding repeated admissions for the same cause. The causes taken into account are the same analysed for mortality were considered. Age-standardized mortality rates (TSDM) and the temporal trends of TSDM for four periods (1971-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2006) were computed. Age-standardized mortality/hospitalization ratios (SMR/SHR), with and without adjustment for the deprivation index based on 2001 census data, were calculated: mortality in the years 2000-2006 and hospitalization in 2004-2006. The expected number of events were computed using rates of residents in neighbouring municipalities (municipalities included in 50 km radius circle centred on the study area). Bayesian estimates of mortality/hospitalization ratios (BMR/BHR) at municipal level only and relating maps of the Bayesian risk estimators were elaborated. Congenital malformations (MC) were analysed using data from Tuscan Registry of Birth Defect in 1992-2006 period, relative to outcomes of pregnancies in women resident in the municipalities of study area, wherever the birth or termination of pregnancy occurred. The ratio between observed and expected cases (O/A), with expected defined according to regional rate, were calculated and O/A Bayesian estimates (BMR) are showed only at municipal level. The low weight and the males/females ratio at birth were analysed using data from Tuscany Birth Certificates, covering period 2001-2007, excluding births occurred in facilities outside Tuscany Region. For Low birth weight ({$<$} 2,500 grams), very low birth weight ({$<$} 1,500 grams), low birth weight in women with normal gestational age or greater than 36 weeks, gestational age less than 36 weeks, and the frequency of males, the observed/expected ratio was calculated, with the expected number defined according to regional rate. RESULTS: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND: High levels of arsenic in drinking water distribution emerges as a critical element, so that several municipalities resorted to granting exemptions for the parameters laid down by the Legislative Decree in force (D.Lgs 31/01). However, during the final phase of the study, new blast systems activated in the SGA decreased the arsenic levels in the water supply, reaching values not requiring derogations, which, instead, are still effective in some NGA municipalities. Air quality data, from Tuscany Regional Agency for Environmental Protection-ARPAT, show that geothermal activities are able to affect air quality, especially with hydrogen sulphide in NGA, and hydrogen sulphide and mercury in SGA. A significant contribution to the presence of mercury in air is due to previous metallurgical sites. Although mercury levels are below WHO guideline values, in SGA nearby Siena, values were significantly higher than in other geothermal areas, because of power plant PC2 (turned off in July 2011) in Piancastagnaio municipality. The hydrogen sulphide concentration levels were generally lower than WHO reference values, with occasional excesses over guideline value for health protection (150 \textmu g/m3 as average of the 24 hours). Olfactory pollution was more critic with values exceeding 7-10 \textmu g/m3 range even in areas without geothermal plants. RESULTS: POPULATION'S HEALTH STATUS: This study evaluated health status of resident population in geothermal areas analysing geographic and temporal distribution of mortality, hospitalization and reproductive health outcomes (congenital malformations, low birth weight, sex ratio among newborns). In both geothermal areas mortality rates steadily declined from 1971 to 2006, in males and females, in line with the regional trends. In 2000-2006 period, in the overall geothermal area a significant mortality excess was observed for all causes among males (2,312 deaths, 2,146 expected), but not among females, using as reference residents in neighbouring municipalities. The mortality excess among males was more evident for infectious diseases (25 deaths, 10 expected), especially tuberculosis (8 deaths, 2 expected), for respiratory diseases (218 deaths, 170 expected), in particular pneumoconiosis, including deaths from silicosis (51 deaths, 14 expected), and for nervous system diseases (72 deaths, 56 expected). Among females significant mortality excess for liver cirrhosis (35 deaths, 25 expected) emerged, while mortality from cardiovascular diseases and ischemic heart diseases were significantly lower than expected. In the NGA, mortality among men was lower than expected for all cancers (-15\%), in particular for lung cancer (- 25\%), while values significantly in excesses were observed for infectious diseases (11 observed, 4 expected) and respiratory diseases (90 observed, 73 expected), expecially pneumoconiosis (20 observed, 6 expected). Among females, significant mortality excesses for ovarian cancer (17 observed, 10 expected) and for circulatory disorders of brain (170 observed, 140 expected) resulted. In the SGA, mortality was more critical, accounting for majority of the excesses detected in overall Geothermal Area. In fact, only infectious diseases and pneumoconiosis were detected in excess in both the geothermal areas. In the SGA, excess of general mortality among males (1,431 deaths; 1,245 expected) but not among females emerged. Even for all cancers, an excess among males (505 deaths, 419 expected) was observed, in particular for cancer of stomach (53 deaths, 44 expected, not statistically significant after adjusting for DI), liver (39 deaths, 23 expected) and lung (124 deaths, 102 expected) cancer. Mortality in SGA was also in excess for respiratory diseases only among men (128 deaths, 97 expected), mostly due to silicosis (31 deaths, 8 expected), although steadily decreasing since 1971 as observed at regional level. Also tuberculosis resulted in excess in SGA (7 deaths, 1 expected). Among females acute respiratory disease mortality was significantly in excess (41 observed, 29 expected). Temporal trend showed a decline from the 70s to the 90s, with a rising trend in recent years in line with Tuscany region. It should be considered that pneumonia was the commonest cause of death of acute respiratory diseases, which allow for lower reliability of death certificate, especially among the elderly ({$>$} 64 years). Among females resident in SGA a mortality excess from digestive system diseases was observed (72 observed, 55 expected). The hospitalization in the overall Geothermal Area did not show any excess for all causes and all tumours in both genders. Statistically significant excesses for hospital admission from stomach cancer among males (49 observed, 38 expected) and females (42 observed, 28 expected), and from lymphohematopoietic tumours among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (15 observed, 5 expected), were observed. As mortality analysis highlighted, also hospital admissions by geothermal areas and gender showed a worst picture in SGA than in NGA. In the latter, a significant excess of hospital admissions from all causes among females (1,357 observed, 1,284 expected) but not among males (1,193 observed, 1,141 expected) and an excess - close to statistical significance - from all tumours only among females (297 observed; 272 expected) were observed. Furthermore, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions from digestive system diseases in both genders (M: 392 observed, 350 expected; F: 300 observed, 268 expected), from dementias (16 observed, 8 expected) and from lympho hematopoietic cancers among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (9 observed, 2 expected), were observed. In the SGA, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for stomach cancer (M: 32 observed, 21 expected, not significant after adjusting by DI; F: 29 observed, 18 expected), for respiratory diseases (M: 408 observed, 351 expected; F: 339 observed, 277 expected) and for renal failure (M: 61 observed, 41 expected; F: 52 observed, 34 expected) were observed in both genders.

For mother cohorts born after 1972 and reaching adulthood in the early and mid-1990s, heights declined. Evidence on both the length and weight of babies corroborates this pattern as there is a noticeable connection between the height and weight of newborns and that of their mothers, on the one hand, and social and demographic indicators, on the other. In our data, we see their values trace a ``U'' shaped curve with troughs near the mid-1990s. Thus, the anthropometric evidence concerning newborns as well as mothers points to the impact of strains on living standards that were prevalent during the period of economic restructuring of the 1990s. This is a general result that confirms a recurring pattern: periods of economic transitions are almost always accompanied by biological stress. In the Soviet and post-Soviet periods, newborns in Moscow and St. Petersburg were definitely inferior to European and white American newborns in weight and, most likely, in stature as well, as there is a close relationship between stature and weight.},

It becomes more understandable, however, once it is realized that (a) lightning bolts are common in the region, causing considerable destruction and death, and (b) lightning, like certain other celestial phenomena such as a haze-covered sun, is interpreted by the Tarahumara as a sign of serious cosmic disruption.

  abstract = {Prenatal exposures have meaningful effects on health across the life course. Innovations in causal inference have shed new light on these effects. Here, we motivate the importance of innovation in the characterization of fecundity, and prenatal selection in particular. We argue that such innovation is crucial for expanding knowledge of the fetal origins of later life health. Pregnancy loss is common, responsive to environmental factors, and closely related to maternal and fetal health outcomes. As a result, selection into live birth is driven by many of the same exposures that shape the health trajectories of survivors. Life course effects that are inferred without accounting for these dynamics may be significantly distorted by survival bias. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations with realistic parameters to examine the implications of prenatal survival bias. We find that even in conservatively specified scenarios, true fetal origin effects can be underestimated by 50\% or more. In contrast, effects of exposures that reduce the probability of prenatal survival but improve the health of survivors will be overestimated. The absolute magnitude of survival bias can even exceed small-effect sizes, resulting in inferences that beneficial exposures are harmful or vice versa. We also find reason for concern that moderately sized true effects, underestimated due to failure to account for selective survival, are missing from scientific knowledge because they do not clear statistical significance filters. This bias has potential real-world costs; policy decisions about interventions to improve maternal and infant health will be affected by underestimated program impact.},

The British social policy was hesitant and to an extent ambivalent at the turn of the nineteenth century in India, it however became assertive and robust particularly after the suppression of the Mutiny. This book is a study of one of the worst social evils, namely female infanticide which was prevalent among a section of Hindus in the present Uttar Pradesh and which was suppressed by the enforcement of social legislation spreading over nearly a century. Apart from tracing the growth of British social policy in India with reference to the practice of female infanticide, the study focuses attention on the complexities of the problems of social legislation and social reform in India. Significant changes in caste relationship and behaviour patterns occurred as a consequence of these processes.},

In this paper, we extend two recently proposed methodologies for bubble detection that alleviate this problem by using market expectations of future prices. Both methodologies provide no evidence of speculative bubbles.},

Until recently, excess male mortality was thought to be caused by biological and genetic differences between the sexes, with boys being biologically weaker and therefore more susceptible to premature death (Naeyeet al. 1971; Waldron 1998). In previously published research (Pongou 2013), I showed some limitations of this biological hypothesis and proposed the "preconception origins" hypothesis, which holds that some of the preconception and prenatal environmental factors that have been shown to determine the offspring sex ratio also explain the male-female difference in early-age mortality.},

The commercial framework of this trade was integrated into ethnic, cultural, and religious systems, yet for its efficient operation could not rely solely on these social institutions. Temporary cooperation of itinerant slave traders is considered and then projected onto the broader patterns of commercial organization. It is shown that similar pressures resulted in comparable outcomes: partnerships were formed to take advantage of economies of scale in commercial services and to limit cooperation problems. This demonstrates that the organization of the trans-Saharan slave trade was economically rational and can be analysed in terms of cooperative and non-cooperative strategies. Moreover, it is argued that the trade was not restrained by social institutions but versatile in adapting its economic institutions to specific market imperfections. It is concluded that recent economic models are more useful in explaining the economic behaviour of slave traders than conventional neoclassical economics.},

  abstract = {Background: The infant mortality rate (IMR) has been criticised as a measure of population health because it is narrowly based and likely to focus the attention of health policy on a small part of the population to the exclusion of the rest. More comprehensive measures such as disability adjusted life expectancy (DALE) have come into favour as alternatives. These more comprehensive measures of population health, however, are more complex, and for resource poor countries, this added burden could mean diverting funds from much needed programmes. Unfortunately, the conjecture, that DALE is a better measure of population health than IMR, has not been empirically tested. Methods: IMR and DALE data for 1997 were obtained from the World Bank and the World Health Organisation, respectively, for 180 countries. Findings: There is a strong (generally) linear association between DALE and IMR (r=0.91). Countries with low DALE tend to have a high IMR. The countries with the lowest IMRs had DALEs above that predicted by the regression line. Interpretation: There is little evidence that the use of IMR as a measure of population health has a negative impact on older groups in the population. IMR remains an important indicator of health for whole populations, reflecting the intuition that structural factors affecting the health of entire populations have an impact on the mortality rate of infants. For countries with limited resources that require an easily calculated, pithy measure of population health, IMR may remain a suitable choice.},

  abstract = {Acceleration of progress in nutrition will require effective, large-scale nutrition-sensitive programmes that address key underlying determinants of nutrition and enhance the coverage and effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions. We reviewed evidence of nutritional effects of programmes in four sectors\textemdash agriculture, social safety nets, early child development, and schooling. The need for investments to boost agricultural production, keep prices low, and increase incomes is undisputable; targeted agricultural programmes can complement these investments by supporting livelihoods, enhancing access to diverse diets in poor populations, and fostering women's empowerment. However, evidence of the nutritional effect of agricultural programmes is inconclusive\textemdash except for vitamin A from biofortification of orange sweet potatoes\textemdash largely because of poor quality evaluations. Social safety nets currently provide cash or food transfers to a billion poor people and victims of shocks (eg, natural disasters). Individual studies show some effects on younger children exposed for longer durations, but weaknesses in nutrition goals and actions, and poor service quality probably explain the scarcity of overall nutritional benefits. Combined early child development and nutrition interventions show promising additive or synergistic effects on child development\textemdash and in some cases nutrition\textemdash and could lead to substantial gains in cost, efficiency, and effectiveness, but these programmes have yet to be tested at scale. Parental schooling is strongly associated with child nutrition, and the effectiveness of emerging school nutrition education programmes needs to be tested. Many of the programmes reviewed were not originally designed to improve nutrition yet have great potential to do so. Ways to enhance programme nutrition-sensitivity include: improve targeting; use conditions to stimulate participation; strengthen nutrition goals and actions; and optimise women's nutrition, time, physical and mental health, and empowerment. Nutrition-sensitive programmes can help scale up nutrition-specific interventions and create a stimulating environment in which young children can grow and develop to their full potential.},

We discuss a model of potential bias in measuring observed fetal deaths, and present the sex ratio of live births as an alternative fetal health endpoint, taking advantage of the finding that males are more vulnerable to side effects of maternal stress in utero. We find the CAAA caused substantial improvements in fetal health, in addition to previously identified reductions in post-natal mortality.},

Scenes of Subjection examines the forms of domination that usually go undetected; in particular, the encroachments of power that take place through notions of humanity, enjoyment, protection, rights, and consent. By looking at slave narratives, plantation diaries, popular theater, slave performance, freedmen's primers, and legal cases, Hartman investigates a wide variety of "scenes" ranging from the auction block and minstrel show to the staging of the self-possessed and rights-bearing individual of freedom. While attentive to the performance of power\textendash the terrible spectacles of slaveholders' dominion and the innocent amusements designed to abase and pacify the enslaved\textendash and the entanglements of pleasure and terror in these displays of mastery, Hartman also examines the possibilities for resistance, redress and transformation embodied in black performance and everyday practice. This important study contends that despite the legal abolition of slavery, emergent notions of individual will and responsibility revealed the tragic continuities between slavery and freedom. Bold and persuasively argued, Scenes of Subjection will engage readers in a broad range of historical, literary, and cultural studies.},

These moral evaluations are, in turn, influenced by such external contingencies as popula\- tion demography, social and economic factors, subsistence strategies, house\- hold composition, and by cultural ideas concerning the nature of infancy and childhood, definitions of personhood, and beliefs about the soul and its immortality. MOTHER LOVE AND CHILD DEATH Of all the many factors that endanger the lives of young children, by far the most difficult to examine with any degree of dispassionate objectivity is the quality of parenting. Historians and social scientists, no less than the public at large, are influenced by old cultural myths about childhood inno\- cence and mother love as well as their opposites. The terrible power and significance attributed to maternal behavior (in particular) is a commonsense perception based on the observation that the human infant (specialized as it is for prematurity and prolonged dependency) simply cannot survive for very long without considerable maternal love and care. The infant's life depends, to a very great extent, on the good will of others, but most especially, of course, that of the mother. Consequently, it has been the fate of mothers throughout history to appear in strange and distorted forms. They may appear as larger than life or as invisible; as all-powerful and destructive; or as helpless and angelic. Myths of the maternal instinct compete, historically, witli -myths of a universal infanticidal impulse.},

The pressure that biology exerts on human history is strong throughout much of the ``peripheral'' world, where disease epidemics and famines consign millions to an early grave, and where the ``life of the species'' is only marginally under human control.1 In the world in which most of us live, however, the dialectic between fertility and mortality has lost its edge, become buried in the consciousness of most North Americans and Europeans, for whom each birth signifies new life rather than the threat of premature death, and for whom some control over fertility is assumed. Yet it was not long ago in our own ``western'' world (barely more than a hundred years) when reproduction was as unpredictable, and death as random and chaotic as in the contemporary Third World. In many remote rural areas and in the squalid urban slums of the 19th century, there was hardly a family that had not experienced firsthand the death of an infant or small child. Public health and sanitation, child and adult labor laws, and social welfare legislation had yet to vanquish the great uncertainties of individual human existence.},

In the mid-nineteenth century, observed Goodrich, books and papers are ``diffused even among country towns, so as to be in the hands of all, young and old.''1},

Their importance for the historical development of our continent would be difficult to exaggerate; for our relationship with the peoples of the other continents of the world as well. This book is an attempt to recover the different familial systems and compare them with one another. The studies range from Russia, Poland, Hungary and Austria to Scandinavia, Flanders and Britain. All the influences which have affected the character and composition of European households are taken into account. The analysis covers their function as productive work groups, in the procreation and bringing up of children, and in the support of the elderly, and their relationship with the wider society and its norms along with its political organization, central and local. Claims that inheritance customs and inheritance practice and the occupation of the household head exerted a powerful influence on the size and composition of households are subjected to rigorous and systematic investigation.},

This paper adds to these explanations by showing that common lands positively contributed to achieving significantly higher levels of both schooling expenditure and literacy rates. By supporting both municipal and households' incomes, these collective resources sustained not only the local supply of education, but also the demand for it, although their influence decreased over time. Likewise, either low levels of economic development prevented human capital from growing endogenously or demand factors were not as important as previously argued. Lastly, even though the active intervention of the central government was crucial to promote education, its effort was not enough and human capital in Spain lagged behind other European countries in the early stages of economic development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous research suggests that maternal exposure to acute stress has a negative impact on the duration of pregnancy, and that this effect may vary by the time of exposure. It has also been proposed that stress exposure reduces the ratio of male-to-female births. To date, no study has jointly examined both outcomes, although they may be strongly related. Using population-level data with no selectivity, we jointly study the sex-specific effect of stress on the duration of pregnancy and the observed sex ratio among pregnant women exposed to a major earthquake in Chile. METHODS In a quasi-experimental design, women exposed to the earthquake in different months of gestation were compared with women pregnant 1 year earlier. Estimates from a comparison group of pregnant women living in areas not affected by the earthquake were also examined to rule out confounding trends. Regression models were used to measure the impact of earthquake exposure on gestational age and preterm birth by sex across month of gestation. A counterfactual simulation was implemented to assess the effect of the earthquake on the secondary sex ratio accounting for the differential impact of stress on gestational age by sex. RESULTS Earthquake exposure in Months 2 and 3 of gestation resulted in a significant decline in gestational age and increase in preterm delivery. Effects varied by sex, and were much larger for female than male pregnancies. Among females, the probability of preterm birth increased by 0.038 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.005, 0.072] in Month 2 and by 0.039 (95\% CI: 0.002, 0.075) in Month 3. Comparable increases for males were insignificant at the conventional P {$<$} 0.05 level. After accounting for the sex-specific impact on gestational age, a decline in the male-to-female ratio in Month 3 of exposure was detected [-0.058 (95\% CI: -0.113, -0.003)]. CONCLUSIONS Maternal exposure to an exogenous stressor early but not late in the pregnancy affects gestational age and the probability of preterm birth. This effect is much stronger in females than males. Stress exposure in early pregnancy may also contribute to a decline in the ratio of male-to-female live births in exposed cohorts.},

We demonstrate that the dramatic rise in infant mortality that occurred in the mid-1970s was accounted for in large part by an increase in death rates from causes which predominate after the first month of life, particularly in the Central Asian republics, but also in the more developed Baltic and European republics. Improvements in the classification of perinatal deaths do not appear to have played a significant role in explaining trends in reported infant mortality in the 1970s, but may have been responsible for some of the rise (or lack of decline) during the late 1980s. Despite the apparent improvements in the recording of deaths that occurred shortly after birth, there is evidence in several republics of substantial misclassification of early infant deaths as late fetal deaths as recently as 1990. Because such a pattern would lead to the omission of many infant deaths, it appears that infant mortality rates may have been understated in several of the less developed republics even at the end of the period studied.},

Even modest levels of inbreeding allow such a response to selection when there are direct fitness effects of mitochondria on male fertility because inbreeding associates male fertility traits with mitochondrial matrilines. Male viability effects of mitochondria are also selectable whenever there are indirect fitness effects of males on the fitness of their sisters. When either of these effects is sufficiently strong, we show that there are conditions that allow the spread of mitochondria with direct effects that are harmful to females, contrary to standard expectation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of organelles and endosymbionts and genomic conflict.},

His principal focus was Brazil, where he is considered one of the founders of contemporary Brazilian Anthropology. He made major contributions to the concept of cultural areas for Latin America (including a typology of subcultures for the region) and to the notion that race was a cultural construct. He conducted extensive research in the Amazon among indigenous and peasant peoples. Out of the latter came his classic description of peasant life (e.g. rubber tappers) in the Amazon- Amazon Town. Co-authors Conrad Kottak and Richard Pace have revised and updated Charles Wagley's Amazon Town to coincide with Wagley's 100th birthday in late 2013. Revisions include a new foreword by Conrad Kottak, and a new preface and chapter by Richard Pace.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews evidence concerning genetic factors that influence sex differences in human mortality, with attention to the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Some widely quoted earlier conclusions, for example, that males have consistently higher fetal mortality than females, are not supported by current evidence. For example, for late fetal mortality, males had higher rates than females in earlier historical data, but not in recent data for several advanced industrial countries. This reflects a changing balance between an inherently greater female vulnerability for one major type of late fetal mortality and inherently greater male vulnerability for several other types of late fetal mortality that have declined in importance as health care has improved. Males appear to be inherently more vulnerable than females to infant mortality, although the causes of this vulnerability are poorly understood. X-linked immunoregulatory genes appear to contribute to greater female resistance to infectious diseases. Despite these apparent inherent advantages for females, in some situations females have had higher infant mortality and higher infectious disease mortality than males, apparently due to environmental disadvantages for females, such as less adequate diet and health care. Inherent sex differences in reproductive physiology and anatomy contribute to higher female mortality for breast cancer and maternal mortality. For these causes of death, as for the other categories discussed, the death rates and thus the contributions to sex differences in total mortality vary considerably depending on environmental conditions. Several hypothesized contributions of sex hormones to sex differences in mortality are at present controversial due to contradictions and limitations in the available data. There may be effects of male sex hormones on sex differences in behavior which contribute to males' higher death rates for accidents and other violent causes. Women's endogenous sex hormones may reduce women's risk of ischemic heart disease. For both violent deaths and ischemic heart disease it appears that any genetic contributions to sex differences in mortality are strongly reinforced by the cultural influences that foster more risky behavior in males, including more use of weapons, employment in hazardous occupations, heavy alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. It appears that these cultural influences on sex differences in behavior are widespread cross-culturally in part because of the effects of inherent sex differences in reproductive functions on the cultural evolution of sex roles. These examples illustrate the complexity and importance of interactions between genetic and environmental factors in determining sex differences in human mortality.},

We used cross-sectional data from the baseline survey of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors in Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study, conducted in 2002\textendash 2005. The study examined 24,012 men and women born between 1933 and 1957, randomly selected from the general populations of Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland) and six towns of the Czech Republic. To allow for age-related height loss we estimated maximum attained height. Parental education and household item ownership at age 10 were used as markers of childhood socioeconomic conditions. In all 5-year birth cohorts, Novosibirsk men and women were shortest. There were positive and statistically significant secular trends in childhood conditions and in maximum adult height. Adjustment for childhood conditions explained about one third of the trend in height. There appeared to be a small reduction in height of persons born during the Second World War which was, however, only significant in Novosibirsk. These results suggest that secular trends in height mirror, but are not wholly explained by, trends in socioeconomic circumstances in early life.},

This study conducted a systematic search of this topic. Methods A scoping review of the literature was initially carried out in January 2012 and this was formally updated for contemporaneity in December 2017. A systematic search of the literature subsequently followed in May 2019 and was conducted based on PRISMA statement's flow diagram. The search was applied across five databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, PubMed, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science and was restricted to January 1, 1990 to May 31, 2019. The systematic review stopped at screening stage of the PRISMA. A narrative approach was adopted to report study findings. Results 494 studies were included. Ten factors were identified from the literature as having an influence on M/F, with stress and sex-selective termination being the most predominant. Additional factors included the hormonal theory, geographical trends, coital rates, radiation, secular trends, seasonality and theoretical modeling. Discussion Future studies addressing M/F should adopt similar methodologies in order to provide the possibility of comparison between findings and a more formal form of systematic review.},

Data are presented to show that the sex-ratio at conception is significantly higher than sex-ratio at birth. The lesser percentage of males at birth than at conception is accounted for by a differential prenatal mortality bearing more heavily upon the male fetus than upon the female fetus. Thus the sex-ratio at birth is a function of the sex-ratio at conception and the sex-ratio of intrauterine mortality. Various lines of approach are utilized to prove that social factors affect the amount of prenatal mortality and finally the sex-ratio at birth. A group of 5,466 completed families, forming a "higher" social class, are utilized to test the general hypothesis. They show a significantly higher sex-ratio at birth than does the general population. The conclusion is reached that more desirable social environments are important factors tending to raise the sex-ratio at birth. As such environments become more general, they will operate in the direction of a higher proportion of male births.},

This article attempts intellectual arbitrage by joining these two literatures. The linkage turns on the neglected part two of the `Williams thesis': that slavery and the slave trade, once vital for the expansion of British industry and commerce, were no longer needed by the nineteenth century. In contrast to recent assertions of the centrality of slavery for US economic development, the article argues that part two of the Williams thesis applies with equal force to nineteenth-century America. Unlike sugar, cotton required no large investments of fixed capital and could be cultivated efficiently at any scale, in locations that would have been settled by free farmers in the absence of slavery. Cheap cotton was undoubtedly important for the growth of textiles, but cheap cotton did not require slavery. The best evidence for this claim is that after two decades of war, abolition, and Reconstruction, cotton prices returned to their prewar levels. In both countries, the rise of anti-slavery sentiment was not driven by the prospect of direct economic benefits, but major economic interest groups acquiesced in abolition because they no longer saw slavery as indispensable.},
